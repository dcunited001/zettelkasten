* Ideas
** Profile Injection
+ Several options to achieve this:
  - templates (yuck)
  - profile builds (deploys .. yuck)
+ But some kind of portable dependency injection would be convenient
  - input/output redirection with =tee=
  - socket-oriented methods like =socat=

**** Examples of similar techniques
+ metasploit and pen-testing should probably use some of the same tricks:
  - for dynamic config mgmt, decentralization or obfuscation: one must handle
    data streams containing config pieces for other data streams
+ tricks from orchestration frameworks, esp if transmission or routing of
  config/state from =etcd= (or elsewhere) needs to be handed off indirectly to
  scripts/processes.
+ these techs would probably be found in orchestration of serverless functions
