#+DESCRIPTION: notes

* Overview

** Issues

** Misc
+ A great way to dump info related to window managers is =fcitx5 --diagnose=


* GTK
** Issues
*** Logging

+ See [[https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/running.html][GTK3 docs on running apps]] for info on environment variables
  + including =GTK_DEBUG=, which can be set to a list of options

+ emacs with GTK logging: =GOBJECT_DEBUG=instance-count GTK_DEBUG=interactive emacs --debug-init=

*** Styling

Most GTK apps are styled with CSS afaik. When an Linux app's config menu offers
paths for CSS stylesheet ... then I guess this is a pretty good hint that it's
gnome (I'm new here... not really)

*** Debugging

**** Interactive Debugging

+ The =GDK_DEBUG= variable and =--gdk-debug= option control debugging.
+ Use =GDK_DEBUG=interactive= for an interactive debugger. In some apps, it can
  be launched with =C-s-i= or =C-s-d=

This doesn't seem to work for zealdocs though... but looking at the initial tab,
theres a button for "install/update docsets" ... so I can add =perl= ... because
I apparently need it for 5 minutes lol. No offense to all the CPAN fans out
there.

**** Building GTK applications to support debugging
**** Attaching to GTK applications
**** Getting stack traces out of a GTK Application

* KDE

**** TODO roam link to [[file:/data/repo/kde/README.org][/data/repo/kde/README.org]]
