* Configure TPM 1.2
** Activate TPM to store encryption keys
- TPM requires that you set an administrative password on the BIOS
  - otherwise your TPM can be disabled/deactivated (keys inaccessible to your OS)
  - or cleared (keys destroyed)
  - and etc.

- This needs to be done immediately after encrypting the disks
  - the system BIOS will otherwise store some keys/secrets anyways

- This will require multiple restarts
  - After configuring BIOS to both enable & activate TPM
  - Then the OS should detect it.

** Configure TPM 1.2
Centos reports that only tpm2_tools are installed

- The Dell 7020 has a TPM 1.2 chip in the motherboard
  - My AMD mobo has a TPM 2.0 in the motherboard, but allows another TPM chip
  - TODO: can both chips be used simultaneously?
    - no, the system can only be made aware of one by bios AFAIK
  - The commandline calls differ for =tpm-tools= and =tpm2-tools=


** Apps that can use the TPM (via articles above)

- StrongSwan clients (VPN) via TrouSers (from 1.2)
- Cisco AnyConnect
- TrustedGRUB (the link is for grub2 extensions)
- Microsoft BitLocker
- Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
- OpenPGP / GNU PG
- Thunderbird for encrypted e-mail and signed e-mail
- Microsoft OutLook for encrypted e-mail and signed e-mail
- Web Browsers like Chromium, Google Chrome, Firefox

*** Misc TPM Resuorces

- [[yt:][Fix blocked snapshots in Windows 11 VM running under Proxmox PVE]]

* Configure TPM 2.0

** Ensure that removing TPM won't bork your boot, luks or crypto

If so, you'll need to disable it.

** Install hardware and ensure BIOS is configured to use the correct TPM

Also, set to clear in BIOS. Reboot.

** Install tpm2-tools and tpm2-abrmd

+ Ensure that the tpm2-abrmd is running and enabled. Reboot.

#+begin_quote
tpm2-abrmd may not be required at this point. There is also the in-kernel
resource manager, which provides =/dev/tpmrm0= in addition to =/dev/tpm0=

The broker wraps access for various reasons.

** Host Key Auth

*** ssh-tpm-agent

+ [[https://linderud.dev/blog/store-ssh-keys-inside-the-tpm-ssh-tpm-agent/][Configure Host Keys in TPM using ssh-tpm-agent]]

*** tpm2-pkcs11

This helps with managing the keys. See [[Https://incenp.org/notes/2020/tpm-based-ssh-key.html][Tpm Based Ssh Key]]

There is also [[https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-pkcs11][tpm2-software/tpm2-pkcs11]], so if an =ssh-agent= intermediary is
launched for =sshd= (with =-P $p11= under separate ownership as =sshd=), then could
you just list the key in ... =/etc/sshd_config=?

+ The options for pointing to a PKCS#11 lib are unavailable
+ you can't easily restart sshd (hard to cycle multiple deps during update)
+ you may not want to point sshd at an arbitrary dynamic library.
