* Configure TPM
** Activate TPM to store encryption keys
- TPM requires that you set an administrative password on the BIOS
  - otherwise your TPM can be disabled/deactivated (keys inaccessible to your OS)
  - or cleared (keys destroyed)
  - and etc.

- This needs to be done immediately after encrypting the disks
  - the system BIOS will otherwise store some keys/secrets anyways

- This will require multiple restarts
  - After configuring BIOS to both enable & activate TPM
  - Then the OS should detect it.

** Configure TPM 1.2
Centos reports that only tpm2_tools are installed

- The Dell 7020 has a TPM 1.2 chip in the motherboard
  - My AMD mobo has a TPM 2.0 in the motherboard, but allows another TPM chip
  - TODO: can both chips be used simultaneously?
    - no, the system can only be made aware of one by bios AFAIK
  - The commandline calls differ for =tpm-tools= and =tpm2-tools=


** Apps that can use the TPM (via articles above)

- StrongSwan clients (VPN) via TrouSers (from 1.2)
- Cisco AnyConnect
- TrustedGRUB (the link is for grub2 extensions)
- Microsoft BitLocker
- Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
- OpenPGP / GNU PG
- Thunderbird for encrypted e-mail and signed e-mail
- Microsoft OutLook for encrypted e-mail and signed e-mail
- Web Browsers like Chromium, Google Chrome, Firefox

*** Misc TPM Resuorces
