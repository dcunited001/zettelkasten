** EDITOR

*** Output handling when =vim= is a subordinate process

How do you setup vim CLI to pipe a saved buffer to GnuGP, but without actually
/saving/ it, even as a temporary file? Would I use a named file descriptor in
Bash? Many tools allow you to set =EDITOR= with few constraints.

For =vim= specifically, i'm only getting results for Vim's GnuPG plugin, which
while interesting is also somewhat obvious (and difficult to suppress from
search results)

**** Solution: Run commands from fresh =vim= session

Suggested to use:

+ prevent bare write to tmpfiles: =:set buftype=nofile=
+ to write: =:w !gpg -e -r recip@mail.org -o afile.gpg=
+ to read: =:r !gpg -d bfile.gpg=
