** EDITOR

*** Output handling when =vim= is a subordinate process

How do you setup vim CLI to pipe a saved buffer to GnuGP, but without actually
/saving/ it, even as a temporary file? Would I use a named file descriptor in
Bash? Many tools allow you to set =EDITOR= with few constraints.

**** For =vim= specifically

i'm only getting results for Vim's GnuPG plugin, which while interesting is also
somewhat obvious (and difficult to suppress from search results)
