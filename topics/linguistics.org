* Grammar

** Proto Grammar

*** Word Order

For proto-language in animals to recent humans (about 100,000 BP to 20,000 BP),
since, at some point, they did not psychologically have a fully differentiated
concept of self and/or subject, they also could not have intentionally framed
early grammar using a subject. In my speculative opinion, early grammar would
have centered around verbs and objects.

According to wikipedia, academics believe language originated as SOV, which I
think is ridiculous.

**** The subject who is doing/experiencing is a later development

You don't /need/ the concepts of subject/self to begin formulating
language. Furthermore, for the concept of subject to be formalized in language
-- where there is one communicating and someone communicated to -- then the
concept of subject needs to be sufficiently socialized.

**** Initially, objects are implicit

For early language/communication, /the objects are implicit/ in the world around
you. That is, early humans would be aware of the objects that other humans in
the group were immediately aware of.

You only need objects when:

1. you need to pullback a concept of time to abstractly refer to things
   that have happened or could happen.
2. you need to convey more complicated relationships between specific things,
   which itself is conditionally predicated on a less complicated grammer or
   protolanguage already existing.

The objects implicitly exist because early humans can be aware of what other
early humans are aware of. Since you know there is a sensory image in another
human's mind, objects & subjects can be dropped and statements /could/ still be
understood.

**** Initially verbs have the greatest need for explicit reference

Though objects project sensory images into the early humans' minds, which
attains social consensus (i.e. we both know what we both see/hear), they may
lack definite relationships, which is why the articulation of those
relationships needs to be explicit. It's this articulation to convey or affirm
that "what i'm thinking about what we both see/hear" which may be an "giant
leap" for humans to further differentiate language.

The object comes later, when there's a need to refer to things outside of time
or a need for greater specificity via predicates -- i.e.  conditions,
qualifiers, comparatives, superlatives to clarify which objects the verbs are
relating when many percieved objects validate the articulated verbal
relationship.

The subject only arises once there is sufficient temporal abstraction. The
development/growth of the subject should culminate in mythology (to satisfy a
need to cultivate thought/perspective on types of experiences)

** Programming Languages

Of relatively earlier, widespread programming languages,

+ Lisp (S-expressions) and =sh= have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb-initial_word_order][V1 word order (verb-initial)]]
+ Later, more sophisticated language developments have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V2_word_order][V2 word order]], like C++,
  Java, etc.

Describing these as "later" is inaccurate, since neither APL, Algol, COBOL,
Fortran nor other earlier languages can be properly described by a single
paradigm or "grammar". When comparing programming langauges to human languages
in terms of how concepts are "invoked" or "related" by either the computer or
programmer, it's hard to categorize imperative languages (like C) or declarative
programming languages


*** Shell

*** Lisp

*** OOPs
**** Perhaps actually "subject"-oriented

*** Declarative

* Phonology

** As a space

Much of phonetic variation results from the need to "partition" the space of
sounds people can produce into symbols that are distinguishable (in the quality
of the components of sound and in the sequences of sounds)

+ People have a range of sounds their anatomy allows them to produce and this is
  strongly preserved.
+ What we hear is the sound, but this is dependent on the degrees of freedom of
  the facial anatomy: tongue, mouth, nasal, glottal, etc.
+ So the extremes and mean positions of various anatomic positions (when
  focusing air through the vocal chords)
+ When thinking in terms of mathematic language, the sound is the "range" and
  the anatomic positions/movements are the "domain"

*** Vowel Sounds

Variation in perceived vowel sounds. Here, the arrows signify modifications from
the german /umlaut/ or upwards modification: e.g. /Foot/ starts at the mid right
where modifying the vowel pushing it to the top right pluralizes the morpheme to
/Feet/.

[[file:img/german-umlaut-vowel-transitions.png]]

Diphthongs and triphthongs are instead continuous movements through the space of
perceptible vowels. It's just a way of encoding information.

*** Consonent Sounds

Consonants are a bit more complicated. They are more like
modifications/constraints on anatomic positions/timing that produce
characteristic/distinguishable sounds.

There are still anatomic "features" to a consonant sound. For English speakers,
there are many familiar [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_cluster][consonant clusters]] that just "make sense" but there are
many foreign clusters that don't.

|----------+--------------|
| Familiar | "Unfamiliar" |
|----------+--------------|
| str-     | sv-          |
| dr-      | dv-          |
| br-      | brzh-        |
| sk       | czk-         |
| ps-      | -ps-         |
|----------+--------------|

The idea that some transliterated consonants are "hard" to pronounce or seem
unfamiliar is a reaction of english speakers to their own spelling rules which
are distributed to represent English words with less information: mostly
germanic, french, latin and greek derivatives. This is why you need IPA (or
Sanskrit/Devanagari) to more fully represent sounds we find in language.

*** Phonotactics

This is apparently called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics][phonotactics]], though that has more to do with
sequences. Over time, much of the phonemic and morphemic drift that occured in
the evolution of language was shaped by:

+ a need to distinguish sounds to articulate meaning: this involves a "measure"
  of distance between sequences of sounds.
+ the range of phonemes/vowels in language (giving rise to the phonotactics and
  some of the drift in morphemes)
+ a need to express variations in quality/quantity (superlatives/etc)
+ the rhythm/meter of language in poetry
+ a tendency to minimize energy to express concepts, unless it's necessary for
  articulation/clarity or expression/emphasis. the way someone naturally
  pronounces a word changes depending on the surrounding words & sounds or stops
  & grammar. but in "natural sounding" speech it all flows together and this
  minimizes the mental/physical energy required to coordinate speech.

** Apophony

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_a-mutation][Apophony]] describes "alternations within a word/morpheme that conveys grammatical
information ... often inflectional"

*** Ablaut/Umlaut

expressed vowel sounds among similar morphemes or conjugated morphemes.

+ Proto-Indo European [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_ablaut][ablaut]]
+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_strong_verb]["Strong" verbs]]: in germanic languages ablaut or changes to stem vowels can
  denote change in tense, whereas "weak" verbs are phonetically conjugated with a
  dental suffix (-ed or -t, with tounge blocking air towards teeth)

** Evolution

*** Writing Tools
**** Handedness
+ when using many tools to write (pressed/cut by stylus in clay; templated
   chisel on stone), it is possible the modern conception of handedness may
   seem alien to the early literate class.
   - unless i'm missing something, it seems that cuneiform would be particularly
     easy for people to write using their non/dominant hand(s).
  - when juggling many tools, you tend to use both hands. the complexity of
    stone writing would probably make it a small group effort requiring a
    workspace set up to facillitate it.
  - the ancient egyptians seemed to obsess over the legacy of written messages
    (e.g. they would very well understand how long papyrus/etc would last versus
    stone)
    - the leaders would understand this very well and production of paper
      writing tools could be controlled to make most paper/ink inferior (making
      inferior technology in the bronze age: not a problem)
+ the phoenecians and the greeks seem to have horizontally flipped their letters
  - this would be more clear if the clay/papyrus writing samples were compared.
  - ... it may be useful if a culture's priest class mostly taught writers to
    use the less frequently dominant hand. so few people would learn to write
    anyways and were anyone who wasn't formally taught to start writing, it
    would leave a characteristic imprint and provide a basis for
    provenance/validation of writing.
    - it is also useful to distinguish writing people outside of a culture's
      center, especially once the proto-sinaitic writing system spread
      - this occured exactly around the Bronze Age collapse. it's actually
        pretty likely that a lack of control over literacy/writing was a major
        factor in preciptating the chaos.

*** Variation/Evolution in ASL Signs

**** [[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/26/us/american-sign-language-changes.html][How a Visual Language Evolves as Our World Does]]

in which NYT spends +20% of the word count explaining why a gendered sign for
parents is offensive. This makes sense in some situations ... but there's less
effort spent on explaining "social privilege" which is more relevant to deaf
people. That content is instead found immediately after the "critique".

+ That's great though: if someone takes interest and isn't turned off by the
  critcal theory, then they can propagate half-formed woke ideas about
  gender-neutral signs for "parents."
+ Why bother having signs for boy/girl, man/woman or king/queen?  I'm sure
  someone can explain it to the deaf child without writing it down, right?
+ It is irrelevant to tack on political subjects like that to an expository
  interest piece about an identity group whose challenges are often
  overlooked.
+ if you would default to gender-neutral sign for mom/dad, would it be
  inconsistent if you didn't also sign birthing person? Should you invest
  wordcount programming mild unconscious biases in people with a peripheral
  interest in ASL? Who is the article about and who is it for?

Otherwise, interesting -- and I suddenly realized that I am injecting politics
... great!
