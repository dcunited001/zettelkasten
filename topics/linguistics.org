*** Words about Words

**** Portmonteau

The French is not port monteaux. Technically, =portemonteau= arrives via Middle
French with semantic meaning of:

#+begin_quote
carries (wearing), puts (onto) or takes (with but by porting) ... a coat."

No refunds on this literal translation.
#+end_quote

Words and sentences only seem to translate well between adjacent langauges, but
there the similarity is actually misleading. What usually translates more
appropriately (working /from/ a literal translation) are images and expressions
for images.

You can't get the prosody, meter, expression, delivery and image sequence to
comport more than somewhat well for most sentences, for most languages. Some
translations should have restricted vocabulary -- especially like the Tao Te Ching or I
Ching)

Since I checked, the French is "[[https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/mot-valise][mot valise]]" .... (TODO: probably embaraass
myself by typing a lot)


**** Gerund

*** Day Names

While the names of days are almost as fundamental a semiotic notion as the very
concept of a day (which you organize your entire existence around), the
indidental correspondance of days of week to names of Gods in their native
langauge (or the symbols the Gods correspond to) is basically universal across
the planet.

In East Asian cultures, these are known as the [[https://wiktionary.org/wiki/七曜][七曜]] (seven )

| Planet  | Element | English   | French   | Japanese | Korean |
|---------+---------+-----------+----------+----------+--------|
| Sun     | Light   | Sunday    | Dimanche |          |        |
| Moon    | Darkish | Monday    | Lundi    |          |        |
| Mars    | Fire    | Tuesday   | Merdi    | 火曜日   | 화요일  |
| Mercuri | Water   | Wednesday | Mercredi |          |        |
| Jupiter | Wood    | Thursday  | jeudi    |          |        |
| Venus   | Metal   | Friday    | vendredi |          |        |
| Saturn  | Earth   | Saturday  | samedi   | 土曜日   |        |

This can probably be somewhat explained by cultural retransmission causing a
linguistic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation][carcinization]], the a tendency of evolution to converge towards a
single form. Most of the original influences on astrology emerged from Babylon,
who first recorded their systemitized study of the stars, though IMO it's
obviously older than that.

Hmmm more easily (thanks Emacs)

**** Astrology

In a world where ancient people dominated by natures whims, the clear night sky
was one of the few constants ancient people's could count on. They also knew it
was a universal constant from anywhere on earth (without necessarily knowing
about the global topology of earth). More critically, consensus was assumed: all
other ancient peoples looking at a clear sky would see the same night sky,
granted there may be some differences (time/position/appearance). But for the
subset of mythos that traveled across the night, ancient people could know that
anyone else who looked up would see the same stars.

Astrology is the "universal clock in the sky." As the only moving objects, the
planets are then like hands on a cosmic clock. The zodiac and astrology
functioned as a kind of ancient "NTP", around which you can structure social
programs. That could become its telos (or purpose), though it is not an analogy
that holds to the internals of NTP obviously.

A story you tell about the Gods, heros and symbols these represent could maybe
convey an hidden time or season for some sociocultural program to launch in the
future.

*** Kagi

As music is the "universal language," this about as mysterious (to me...) as the
preservation of signified referents by morpheme for the days of the week

#+begin_quote
Translation: isn't it funny that we all name the days of the week with the very
same 5+2 Captian Planet elements?
#+end_quote

The same morpheme signifying key as in musical scale also signifies key as in
lock in many languages.

|----------+---------+-------------------------------------|
| English  | _Key_   | to unlock or musical register/scale |
| French   | _Clef_  | retains the same senses             |
| Japanese | 鍵 kagi | also retains the exact same senses  |
|----------+---------+-------------------------------------|

... but in particular, examine the components of the graphemes

|-------+-----------------------+------------+----------------------------+------------------------------|
| Kanji | kunyomi               | onyomi     |                            |                              |
|-------+-----------------------+------------+----------------------------+------------------------------|
| [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/鍵][鍵]]    | kagi: key             | ken: key   | 金 kane (metal/money/gold) | 建 tate (building/construct) |
| [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/鑰][鑰]]    | kagi: lock (literary) | yaku: lock | 金 kane (metal/money/gold) | 龠 (flute)                   |
|-------+-----------------------+------------+----------------------------+------------------------------|

Kagi's alternative written form is rare, but seems to more clearly denote
"lock", which is included in the above meanings. This alternative grapheme is
also in Korean Hanja and both descend from Chinese at various times.

My own interpretation of the reasoning for how the compound grapheme attains its
meaning: a key (鍵) is a construct (建) for protecting gold (金). 建 could be
alternatively translated as "thing designed with purpose" or simply purpose,
according to wiktionary. Mnemonically, if you have gold in a building, you're
probably going to want to lock that.

But how does it get the musical connotations? What is responsible for making
sound in earlier forms of music? Resonance of strings or bodies which were
eventually made of metal, but not originally.

At what point did a key develop its connotations for translating information?
And why is this universal, along with the connotations of music notations and
protecting an enclosed space?

Much of music was not universal

+ The number of notes in a scale
+ The types of keys/chords/tunings
+ The written form of notes on a ladder.
+ Sharps/Flats as deviations from a key

**** Rang

In French, while =rang= does not signify the notion of a ladder's rungs, in
English, to "climb the ladder" is to move up in rank. Figuratively, the French
concept here denotes separations in grade, tier, social class, standing or rank.

+ They keep all words short (all roots have 5 chars and a specific positioning
  of vowels/consonants)

it would be interesting to visualize the coverage of their semantics on a graph.


* Grammar

** Proto Grammar

*** Word Order

For proto-language in animals to recent humans (about 100,000 BP to 20,000 BP),
since, at some point, they did not psychologically have a fully differentiated
concept of self and/or subject, they also could not have intentionally framed
early grammar using a subject. In my speculative opinion, early grammar would
have centered around verbs and objects.

According to wikipedia, academics believe language originated as SOV, which I
think is ridiculous.

**** The subject who is doing/experiencing is a later development

You don't /need/ the concepts of subject/self to begin formulating
language. Furthermore, for the concept of subject to be formalized in language
-- where there is one communicating and someone communicated to -- then the
concept of subject needs to be sufficiently socialized.

**** Initially, objects are implicit

For early language/communication, /the objects are implicit/ in the world around
you. That is, early humans would be aware of the objects that other humans in
the group were immediately aware of.

You only need objects when:

1. you need to pullback a concept of time to abstractly refer to things
   that have happened or could happen.
2. you need to convey more complicated relationships between specific things,
   which itself is conditionally predicated on a less complicated grammer or
   protolanguage already existing.

The objects implicitly exist because early humans can be aware of what other
early humans are aware of. Since you know there is a sensory image in another
human's mind, objects & subjects can be dropped and statements /could/ still be
understood.

**** Initially verbs have the greatest need for explicit reference

Though objects project sensory images into the early humans' minds, which
attains social consensus (i.e. we both know what we both see/hear), they may
lack definite relationships, which is why the articulation of those
relationships needs to be explicit. It's this articulation to convey or affirm
that "what i'm thinking about what we both see/hear" which may be an "giant
leap" for humans to further differentiate language.

The object comes later, when there's a need to refer to things outside of time
or a need for greater specificity via predicates -- i.e.  conditions,
qualifiers, comparatives, superlatives to clarify which objects the verbs are
relating when many percieved objects validate the articulated verbal
relationship.

The subject only arises once there is sufficient temporal abstraction. The
development/growth of the subject should culminate in mythology (to satisfy a
need to cultivate thought/perspective on types of experiences)

** Programming Languages

Of relatively earlier, widespread programming languages,

+ Lisp (S-expressions) and =sh= have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb-initial_word_order][V1 word order (verb-initial)]]
+ Later, more sophisticated language developments have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V2_word_order][V2 word order]], like C++,
  Java, etc.

Describing these as "later" is inaccurate, since neither APL, Algol, COBOL,
Fortran nor other earlier languages can be properly described by a single
paradigm or "grammar". When comparing programming langauges to human languages
in terms of how concepts are "invoked" or "related" by either the computer or
programmer, it's hard to categorize imperative languages (like C) or declarative
programming languages


*** Shell

*** Lisp

*** OOPs
**** Perhaps actually "subject"-oriented

*** Declarative

* Phonology

** As a space

Much of phonetic variation results from the need to "partition" the space of
sounds people can produce into symbols that are distinguishable (in the quality
of the components of sound and in the sequences of sounds)

+ People have a range of sounds their anatomy allows them to produce and this is
  strongly preserved.
+ What we hear is the sound, but this is dependent on the degrees of freedom of
  the facial anatomy: tongue, mouth, nasal, glottal, etc.
+ So the extremes and mean positions of various anatomic positions (when
  focusing air through the vocal chords)
+ When thinking in terms of mathematic language, the sound is the "range" and
  the anatomic positions/movements are the "domain"

*** Vowel Sounds

Variation in perceived vowel sounds. Here, the arrows signify modifications from
the german /umlaut/ or upwards modification: e.g. /Foot/ starts at the mid right
where modifying the vowel pushing it to the top right pluralizes the morpheme to
/Feet/.

[[file:img/german-umlaut-vowel-transitions.png]]

Diphthongs and triphthongs are instead continuous movements through the space of
perceptible vowels. It's just a way of encoding information.

*** Consonent Sounds

Consonants are a bit more complicated. They are more like
modifications/constraints on anatomic positions/timing that produce
characteristic/distinguishable sounds.

There are still anatomic "features" to a consonant sound. For English speakers,
there are many familiar [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_cluster][consonant clusters]] that just "make sense" but there are
many foreign clusters that don't.

|----------+--------------|
| Familiar | "Unfamiliar" |
|----------+--------------|
| str-     | sv-          |
| dr-      | dv-          |
| br-      | brzh-        |
| sk       | czk-         |
| ps-      | -ps-         |
|----------+--------------|

The idea that some transliterated consonants are "hard" to pronounce or seem
unfamiliar is a reaction of english speakers to their own spelling rules which
are distributed to represent English words with less information: mostly
germanic, french, latin and greek derivatives. This is why you need IPA (or
Sanskrit/Devanagari) to more fully represent sounds we find in language.

*** Phonotactics

This is apparently called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics][phonotactics]], though that has more to do with
sequences. Over time, much of the phonemic and morphemic drift that occured in
the evolution of language was shaped by:

+ a need to distinguish sounds to articulate meaning: this involves a "measure"
  of distance between sequences of sounds.
+ the range of phonemes/vowels in language (giving rise to the phonotactics and
  some of the drift in morphemes)
+ a need to express variations in quality/quantity (superlatives/etc)
+ the rhythm/meter of language in poetry
+ a tendency to minimize energy to express concepts, unless it's necessary for
  articulation/clarity or expression/emphasis. the way someone naturally
  pronounces a word changes depending on the surrounding words & sounds or stops
  & grammar. but in "natural sounding" speech it all flows together and this
  minimizes the mental/physical energy required to coordinate speech.

** Apophony

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_a-mutation][Apophony]] describes "alternations within a word/morpheme that conveys grammatical
information ... often inflectional"

*** Ablaut/Umlaut

expressed vowel sounds among similar morphemes or conjugated morphemes.

+ Proto-Indo European [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_ablaut][ablaut]]
+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_strong_verb]["Strong" verbs]]: in germanic languages ablaut or changes to stem vowels can
  denote change in tense, whereas "weak" verbs are phonetically conjugated with a
  dental suffix (-ed or -t, with tounge blocking air towards teeth)

** Evolution

*** Writing Tools
**** Handedness
+ when using many tools to write (pressed/cut by stylus in clay; templated
   chisel on stone), it is possible the modern conception of handedness may
   seem alien to the early literate class.
   - unless i'm missing something, it seems that cuneiform would be particularly
     easy for people to write using their non/dominant hand(s).
  - when juggling many tools, you tend to use both hands. the complexity of
    stone writing would probably make it a small group effort requiring a
    workspace set up to facillitate it.
  - the ancient egyptians seemed to obsess over the legacy of written messages
    (e.g. they would very well understand how long papyrus/etc would last versus
    stone)
    - the leaders would understand this very well and production of paper
      writing tools could be controlled to make most paper/ink inferior (making
      inferior technology in the bronze age: not a problem)
+ the phoenecians and the greeks seem to have horizontally flipped their letters
  - this would be more clear if the clay/papyrus writing samples were compared.
  - ... it may be useful if a culture's priest class mostly taught writers to
    use the less frequently dominant hand. so few people would learn to write
    anyways and were anyone who wasn't formally taught to start writing, it
    would leave a characteristic imprint and provide a basis for
    provenance/validation of writing.
    - it is also useful to distinguish writing people outside of a culture's
      center, especially once the proto-sinaitic writing system spread
      - this occured exactly around the Bronze Age collapse. it's actually
        pretty likely that a lack of control over literacy/writing was a major
        factor in preciptating the chaos.

*** Variation/Evolution in ASL Signs

**** [[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/26/us/american-sign-language-changes.html][How a Visual Language Evolves as Our World Does]]

in which NYT spends +20% of the word count explaining why a gendered sign for
parents is offensive. This makes sense in some situations ... but there's less
effort spent on explaining "social privilege" which is more relevant to deaf
people. That content is instead found immediately after the "critique".

+ That's great though: if someone takes interest and isn't turned off by the
  critcal theory, then they can propagate half-formed woke ideas about
  gender-neutral signs for "parents."
+ Why bother having signs for boy/girl, man/woman or king/queen?  I'm sure
  someone can explain it to the deaf child without writing it down, right?
+ It is irrelevant to tack on political subjects like that to an expository
  interest piece about an identity group whose challenges are often
  overlooked.
+ if you would default to gender-neutral sign for mom/dad, would it be
  inconsistent if you didn't also sign birthing person? Should you invest
  wordcount programming mild unconscious biases in people with a peripheral
  interest in ASL? Who is the article about and who is it for?

Otherwise, interesting -- and I suddenly realized that I am injecting politics
... great!
