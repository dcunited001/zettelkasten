* DOI Ontology

Since most researchers use non-free bibliography database management systems
(e.g. IDK), the documentation for DOI category/publication ID's is a bit sparse.
This would be the simplest way to sync papers locally or to file devices like
the Kindle DX which is impossible to find on sale. There's got to be an answer
to this besides cloud storage or Google Scholar (limited features), but I don't
know what it is.

  - Uses RDF/OWL to define an ontology
  - This is related to the same XML specs used in Apache SPARQL for censorship
    in social media at scale.
