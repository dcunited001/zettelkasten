& models the formation of dust/voids in plasma. Includes pics of a xenon lamp
shining through the voids formed.

It's not fusion, but it may relate to dynamics that emerge during injection of
heavy isotopes into a fusion ractor: [[https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3026213/component/file_3026320/content][Observation of anomalous impurity transport
