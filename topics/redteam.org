**** XML Format for nmap

***** Converting from DTD to other formats

I tried using [[https://github.com/ncbi/DtdAnalyzer][DtdAnalyzer]], but I'm not sure what it expects. It includes a
=dtd2xml2json= tool which uses =xsl= as an intermediary format.

Trang seems to have worked:

#+begin_src sh :results value silent
# to XSD
trang -I dtd -O xsd nmap.dtd nmap.xsd

# and to RNG, which emacs apparently handles well
trang -I dtd -O rng nmap.dtd nmap.rng
#+end_src

Then after =pip install xsdata-plantuml=

#+begin_src sh :results output file :file img/nmap-uml.svg
xsdata nmap.xsd --output plantuml
plantuml generated/nmap.pu -tsvg
#+end_src

The UML definitions require the edges for composition/etc to be added. Most of
the initial entity types in the DTD specify only =CDATA= and many of the types
are incorrect... However, the =xsdata= library faithfully reproduces python data
classes anyways.

[[file:img/nmap.assoc.svg]]

To properly fix this, the =xsd= needs to be manually edited before the next
processing stages and then reviewed.

*** [[Attack Lab Automation][mikegior/AttackLab-Lite]]

See [[https://www.mgior.com/automating-my-virtual-labs-with-too-many-tools/][Attack Lab Automation]] where [[https://www.mgior.com/updated-attacklab-automation/][part 2]] is more current and critiques the first
post. It describes the network and tools. The repository seems to be a good
example of combining ansible, terraform and packer.

*** [[github:ruzickap/packer-templates][ruzickap/packer-templates]]

These are =json= templates for packer.

Uses roles:
