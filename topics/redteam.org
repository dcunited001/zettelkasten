* CLI

** Network

*** Interlace

[[github:codingo/interlace][codingo/interlace]] extends single-threaded commands with CIDR-notation and
smart-globbing. It's like a network-centric version of GNU Parallels

*** Reconnoitre

[[github:codingo/reconnoitre][codingo/reconnoitre]]

#+begin_quote
A security tool for multithreaded information gathering and
service enumeration whilst building directory structures to store results, along
with writing out recommendations for further testing.

*** Resources

+ [[https://github.com/vdjagilev/nmap-formatter?tab=readme-ov-file][vdjagilev/nmap-formatter]] exports for nmap scan XML (graphviz, markdown, sqlite)

**** [[https://github.com/attacksurge/ax][Ax Framework]] (formerly [[https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom][Axiom]])

+ e.g. from Axiom docs: [[https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/wiki/Scans#example-axiom-scan-modules][Distribute "input matrix" with constraints]] to workers
  running jobs like [[https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/gowitness-a-testers-time-saver/][gowitness]] scans (bundles screenshots + html/headers)
+ [[https://github.com/attacksurge/ax/blob/master/images/json/provisioners/default.json][attacksurge/ax: json/provisioners/default.json]] contains useful references (to
  files, repos, packages, etc)

**** Webmap

[[https://github.com/Anteste/WebMap][WebMap]]: a web dashboard for Nmap XML Report ([[https://anteste.yo.fr/][anteste.yo.fr]])

+ The most recent branch is =1.x=. Run with docker
+ Includes a graph-based map of the network that's mapping.

**** ZenMap

A frontend for nmap

*** Examples

+ [[github.com/gelim/nmap-sap][gelim/nmap-sap]] (python 2): small project with some NMap utilities for a
  specific task: analyzing a network running SAP. Since SAP has many service
  dependencies, this gives insight into how to interface with =nmap -p $probes=.

*** Topics


**** XML Format for nmap

UML Diagrams for the format:

Host-centric

[[file:img/nmap.host.svg]]

Scan-centric

[[file:img/nmap.nmaprun.svg]]


***** Converting from DTD to other formats

I tried using [[https://github.com/ncbi/DtdAnalyzer][DtdAnalyzer]], but I'm not sure what it expects. It includes a
=dtd2xml2json= tool which uses =xsl= as an intermediary format.

Trang seems to have worked:

#+begin_src sh :results value silent
# git clone https://github.com/nmap/nmap && cd nmap
trang -I dtd -O xsd ./docs/nmap.dtd nmap.xsd

# and to RNG, which emacs apparently handles well
trang -I dtd -O rng ./docs/nmap.dtd nmap.rng
#+end_src

Then after =pip install xsdata-plantuml=

#+begin_src sh :results output file :file img/nmap-uml.svg
xsdata nmap.xsd --output plantuml
plantuml generated/nmap.pu -tsvg
#+end_src

The UML definitions require the edges for composition/etc to be added. Most of
the initial entity types in the DTD specify only =CDATA= and many of the types
are incorrect... However, the =xsdata= library faithfully reproduces python data
classes anyways.

[[file:img/nmap.assoc.svg]]

To properly fix this, the =xsd= needs to be manually edited before the next
processing stages and then reviewed.

** IVRE

"Build you a shodan" or something. Should contain the domain model I'm looking
for... (it does)

#+begin_quote
IVRE is an open-source network recon framework, which makes it easy to build
self-hosted, fully controlled alternatives to services such as Shodan, ZoomEye,
Censys (wide network scans), Greynoise (scanners monitoring) and/or PassiveDNS.
#+end_quote
*** Docs

+ [[https://ivre.rocks/][Site]] and [[https://doc.ivre.rocks/en/latest/][docs]]
  - [[https://doc.ivre.rocks/en/latest/install/config.html#databases][Configuration]]
  - [[https://doc.ivre.rocks/en/latest/overview/principles.html#purposes][IVRE Purposes]] probably read this before booting up the docker compose

Service Dependencies:

+ Data Backends:
  - mongo
    - +recommended+ required
    - Since Mongo uses UUID's for documents, you can more easily merge & relink
      distributed scan results that were originally uploaded into specific mongo
      databases.
    - See [[https://github.com/ivre/ivre/blob/master/ivre/db/mongo.py#L301-L412][mongo indexing and migration code]]. also [[https://github.com/ivre/ivre/blob/master/ivre/db/mongo.py#L814-L1031][MongoDBActive]] and [[https://github.com/ivre/ivre/blob/master/ivre/db/mongo.py#L4564-L4605][MongoDBPassive]]
  - postgres/sqlite (see [[https://github.com/ivre/ivre/blob/master/ivre/db/sql/tables.py#L21][./db/sql/tables.py]])
    - only for =passive,nmap,view= purposes. You'll get this error, which is a bit
      hard to trace.
    - Why didn't they use UUIDs for identity?
+ Search:
  - elastic (only on the =view= purpose)

*** Features

+ [[https://doc.ivre.rocks/en/latest/usage/flow.html#flow][IVRE Flow]]: see how traffic flows rom the results of passive +& active+ scans
  (zeek/argus). To manage tasks that ingest traffic, =nomad= would maybe be a good
  choice (lightweight remote execution + monitoring)
  - IVRE supplies some tooling for this.
+

*** Data

+ DB Schema setup: [[https://github.com/ivre/ivre/blob/master/ivre/db/sql/__init__.py][ivre/db/sql/__init__.py]]

post. It describes the network and tools. The repository seems to be a good
example of combining ansible, terraform and packer.

These are =json= templates for packer.

* Reverse Engineering
** Topics

*** Radare, Rizin, Cutter

+ [[https://cutter.re/][Cutter GUI]]
+ [[https://github.com/rizinorg/book/blob/master/src/refcard/intro.md][rizin refcard]] sift has a cheatsheet for radare2. the commands change a bit.

*** Shell Code

**** RISE Presentation

+ shell-code.org
+ github.com/gallop-sled/pwntools-tutorials
+ phoenix challenges (for understanding how c-code translates into assembly to
  construct the stack)

***** Pwntools

****** Shellcode Hardness

+ usually you need to disabled ASLR & stack canaries (to ensure that stack is executable)
+ shellcode harness?

****** Stack overflow protections

Usually the stack/heap are in different parts of the memory. The OS doesn't
allow you to execute what's in the stack (it doesn't usually make sense)

+ Stack canary: places random address in EIR, so kernel (or process?) can ensure
  that the proper memory address is returned to for execution.
+ ASLR: address space randomization (caller can't predict memory addresses)
  - may be possible to circumvent ASLR on small devices (and small processes?)

***** Frida

****** Dynamic Analysis

Frida is like a dynamic debugger (instrumentation framework with intercepter)

+ instead of manual setup, Frida allows you to write scripts to drive debugger
  with javascript. Frida drives the process.
+ Frida allows you to modify the memory image of the binary (example: to
  overwrite arguments to function calls)

+ stalker: code tracing

****** Tracing

Frida can generate the JS scripts necessary to trace syscalls in android apps

+ You can find the code that's making specific syscalls

*** Dissasembly

**** Capstone

There is an emacs project

*** Dynamic Instrumentation
