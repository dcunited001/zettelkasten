** TODO notes from video on Pathwise Condition of GP's

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5jiCtfzqdg&list=PLEJEA9mYfeKjmlBpiuvEZOKIKWdI092tF&index=23&t=752s&pp=gAQBiAQB][Pathwise Conditioning and Non-euclidean Gaussian Processes]]

There's not much non-euclidean GP's in the video, but it's probably one of the
best survey on the topic on Youtube (for GP's applied to ML).

The 2020 paper is even better: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04026][Pathwise Conditioning of Gaussian Processes]]

* Distributions


** Cauchy Distribution

Compare local deltas in distribution with that of larger neighborhoods... which
doesn't work with variance/mean.

*** Examples

**** Thermal radiation

See 3D simulation of a star's internals: [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02040-7][The photometric variability of massive
stars due to gravity waves excited by core convection]]

*** Spectral Broadening

Describes the broadening of spectral lines (explained via potential quantum
effects) into actual observed spectra.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_broadening][Homogenous Broadening]]: micro (local-scale effects)

+ Natural Broadening (radio. decay processes?)
+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_broadening][Thermal Doppler Broadening]]: particle collisions
+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line#Pressure_broadening][Pressure Broadening]]: various effects from:
  - time-scale of emission events which are interrupted
  - changes in energy levels, several effects on the order of $\Delta E \approx
    \frac{1}{r^{n}}$ for $n \in \left{2,3,4,5\right}$

Inhomogenous Broadening: macro, from the curvature or large-scale parameters

+ Macro Doppler: results from movement in the large-scale structure wrt the
  observer (you get better observations from a closer point). the thermal
  doppler results from the local movement of particles in the volume which is
  bounded by the surface. this is somewhat connected to the rotation...
+ Opacity broadening: this leads to reabsorption, where radiation diffuses
  through and the energy scatters into turbulence, causing the spectra to
  broaden out.
  - this may happen in a paradoxical manner at the center of a star ... which I
    was wondering about. Since the matter should be so tightly packed (and
    somewhat ordered by size/mass), it may start exhibiting resonance with
    constraints on motion imposed by size/mass. At larger scales, the motion is
    less random and so the influence that aggregate large scale forces have
    radiate through differently (when imagining with mostly classical mechanics)

  thermal dopple)
