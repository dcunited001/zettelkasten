** TODO notes from video on Pathwise Condition of GP's

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5jiCtfzqdg&list=PLEJEA9mYfeKjmlBpiuvEZOKIKWdI092tF&index=23&t=752s&pp=gAQBiAQB][Pathwise Conditioning and Non-euclidean Gaussian Processes]]

There's not much non-euclidean GP's in the video, but it's probably one of the
best survey on the topic on Youtube (for GP's applied to ML).

The 2020 paper is even better: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04026][Pathwise Conditioning of Gaussian Processes]]
