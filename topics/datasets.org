* Docs

Goddamit it's difficult to find references to this +CGAN+ CKAN software:

+ CTAN :: LaTeX packages
+ CGAL :: Computational Geometry Lib
+ CPAN :: Perl packages
+ GDAL :: Geospatial coordinate conversion

** [[https://www.ckan.org][CKAN]]

+ [[https://catalog.data.gov][catalog.data.gov]] is based on CKAN, afaik. They support open data initiatives
  for many large governments.

** Media

*** MetaBrainz

+ They also have [[https://github.com/metabrainz/bookbrainz-site?tab=readme-ov-file][Bookbrainz]] and Musicbrainz, which contain PostgreSQL database
+ schemas (and probably OpenAPI docs)
+ The metabrainz github org has projects like [[https://github.com/metabrainz][metabrainz/picard]] (which tags a
  music library)

* Issues

* Data.gov

+ [[https://resources.data.gov/categories/data-tools/][Data tools]] (mostly not helpful)
+ [[https://inventory.data.gov/][inventory.data.gov]] no trespassing
+ Catalog.data.gov: "we render HTML to collect analytics. no json here. scram"

** Github

"Code" for "Umerica" ...

+ [[ for][GSA/data.gov]]: a concise list of apps
+ [[https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/blob/main/SYSTEMS.md][GSA/data.gov systems.md]]: a list of Apps, APIs and service dependencies related
  to data.gov. (They renamed the master branch to main! Phew!)

** Docs

Read the [[https://strategy.data.gov/action-plan/#action-20-develop-a-data-standards-repository][2020 Action Plan]] for some context on wtf the government intended to do
five years ago ... a "five year plan" I guess.

*** DCAT-US Metadata

+ [[https://catalog.data.gov/dcat-us/validator][Validator]]
+ [[https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/][Metadata Schema 1.1]]
  - [[https://resources.data.gov/resources/podm-field-mapping/][Field Mappings]]
  - [[https://resources.data.gov/resources/documenting-apis/][Documenting APIs]] all the =data.json= files should list a =distribution= field
    with their catalogs

More or less the UML

**** History

From the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/][W3C standards doc on DCAT v3]]:

#+begin_quote
DCAT is an RDF Vocab designed to facilitate interoperability between data
catalogs published on the web.
#+end_quote

This doc was updated by democrats on August 22, 2024 ... I needed to datecheck
it, since right here at the top, it mentions SPDX. In other words, SPDX won the
"Software Supply Chain Standards" wars.

#+begin_quote
Very many of your tax dollars were used so that no one would know wtf this is.

Oh! There's a UML in the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/][vocab-dcat]] doc...

Oh... DCAT-US more closely aligns with W3C's [[https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-1/][DCAT v1]] (2014)

*** GSDM (formerly DAISM)

[[https://fiscal.treasury.gov/data-transparency/GSDM-current.html][Gov-wide Spending Data Model]], one of two schemas under [[https://resources.data.gov/standards/catalog/][Data Standards Catalog]]

** Resources

*** GSA/ckanext-datajson

LOL "youragency.gov"

#+begin_quote
You can customize the URL that generates the data.json output:

...
ckanext.datajson.path = /data.json
ckanext.datajsonld.path = /data.jsonld
ckanext.datajsonld.id = http://www.youragency.gov/data.json
...
#+end_quote

okay but seriously, how do i automagically find all the =/data.json= files?

Mainly because i hate the browser, but also because it's faster.
