** Networking Randomly Doesn't Work (RSLinx)

luckily it wasn't DDE/OPC or DCOM.

+ Here, it turned out that the configuration in RSLinx needed to be reset under
  a different menu than directly accessing the AB_ETHIP driver.
  - Also, stopping & restarting the driver may help.
+ For some reason, it's necessary to configure the IP Address in the TCP/IP
  properties with the 1992-style Window GUI.
  - The other interface rejects IP address changes.
  - I actually prefer these interfaces: there is far better usage of space and
    it's easier to find things. The new Windows 10+ interfaces are great
    examples of bad UI/UX:
    - far too much wasted space
    - no styling to indicate organization of information
    - everything requires 17 clicks
    - the search functionality is "hit or miss" to say the least.
  - AFA I can tell, the point of the UI/UX in configuration is to copy motifs
    from Apple/Google, while getting users to navigate menus in circles.
    - this slows configuration without Powershell or command line.
