#+DESCRIPTION: notes

This topic should be focused on:

+ Cloud Providers
  - similarities b/w offerings
  - API's and API Clients
+ SDN
  - Virtual Networking
  - Software defined networking

* Docs

* Resources

* Issues

+ [[Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN on Linux for use with Azure Files][Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN on Linux for use with Azure Files]]

** Run AutoDesk apps in cloud


* Providers

I'm using Azure for the Autodesk VM to keep things simple. I'm sure I'll make the rounds across the other providers as my free stuff expires.

I've never used the cloud for personal stuff because it's pricey and I don't like access to projects/services requiring a shit-show migration every 3 months when my "funemployment" catches up to me. !@#$@!%$

** Azure

** Red Hat

** Amazon

** Google

** OpenShift

*** Docs

+ [[https://craig-robinson.medium.com/guide-to-installing-openshift-4-10-ipi-on-bare-metal-4a2c17bc2bb5][Installing Openshift 4.10 IPI on Dell Poweredge]]
  - this should be sufficiently similar to installing OKD
  - it sets up PXE booted Openshift nodes running on bare metal

** OKD

*** Docs

*** Resources
+ [[https://docs.okd.io/4.9/virt/virtual_machines/virt-create-vms.html][Creating VM's]]
  - OKD can run VM's as kubelets like Harvester
  - ... but doing so requires 3 OKD nodes (on bare metal...)

**** Installs
+ [[https://docs.okd.io/4.11/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installing-bare-metal][Deploying a user-provisioned cluster on bare metal]]
+ [[https://docs.okd.io/4.11/installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-prerequisites.html][Deploying an Installer-provisioned cluster on bare metal]]
+ [[https://docs.okd.io/4.11/installing/installing_platform_agnostic/installing-platform-agnostic.html][Installing a cluster on any platform]] (i.e. Proxmox)

*** Issues
**** Mirrors
+ installing behind a firewall practically requires hosting:
  - a FCOS mirror (~1TB of data)
  - a Docker Registry
