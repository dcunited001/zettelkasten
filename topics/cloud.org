This topic should be focused on:

+ Cloud Providers
  - similarities b/w offerings
  - API's and API Clients
+ SDN
  - Virtual Networking
  - Software defined networking

* Docs

* Resources

* Issues

+ [[Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN on Linux for use with Azure Files][Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN on Linux for use with Azure Files]]

** Run AutoDesk apps in cloud


* Pricing

It's a little ridiculous that the tools to help price cloud services are not
more prominent. If you have a budget with cloud and you're not a little
concerned about the ease of use of pricing tools, you should be fired. It's not
a free market if the cloud vendors make their pricing tools slow/awkward. These
should be graphical tools that support markdown/yaml/mermaid or other plain text
formats.

I'm sure that efficient visibility and planning tools are a concern for
managers/etc, but I don't have a budget. This is a hobby.


** Resources

+ [[https://handbook.vantage.sh/][Cloud Cost Handbook]] guides mostly citing AWS. most of this information is on
  the vendors' management consoles, but here it's distilled a bit.

+ [[https://www.infracost.io/blog/cloud-pricing-api/][Infracost GraphQL API]] here it is again, another useful graphql
  API/schema. There's a free version, but they feel that it's worth $50 per
  seat*month for extended features including enforcing policy or triggering
  automations. Why is that?

* Providers

I'm using Azure for the Autodesk VM to keep things simple. I'm sure I'll make the rounds across the other providers as my free stuff expires.

I've never used the cloud for personal stuff because it's pricey and I don't like access to projects/services requiring a shit-show migration every 3 months when my "funemployment" catches up to me. !@#$@!%$

** Azure

** Red Hat

** Amazon

** Google

** OpenShift

*** Docs

*** Resources
+ [[https://craig-robinson.medium.com/guide-to-installing-openshift-4-10-ipi-on-bare-metal-4a2c17bc2bb5][Installing Openshift 4.10 IPI on Dell Poweredge]]
  - this should be sufficiently similar to installing OKD
  - it sets up PXE booted Openshift nodes running on bare metal

** OKD

*** Docs

*** Resources
+ [[https://docs.okd.io/4.9/virt/virtual_machines/virt-create-vms.html][Creating VM's]]
  - OKD can run VM's as kubelets like Harvester
  - ... but doing so requires 3 OKD nodes (on bare metal...)

**** Installs
+ [[https://docs.okd.io/4.11/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installing-bare-metal][Deploying a user-provisioned cluster on bare metal]]
+ [[https://docs.okd.io/4.11/installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-prerequisites.html][Deploying an Installer-provisioned cluster on bare metal]]
+ [[https://docs.okd.io/4.11/installing/installing_platform_agnostic/installing-platform-agnostic.html][Installing a cluster on any platform]] (i.e. Proxmox)

*** Issues
**** Mirrors
+ installing behind a firewall practically requires hosting:
  - a FCOS mirror (~1TB of data)
  - a Docker Registry
