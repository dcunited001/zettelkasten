#+TITLE:     TUI
#+AUTHOR:    David Conner
#+EMAIL:     noreply@te.xel.io
#+DESCRIPTION: notes

+ TUI's usually have an =ncurses= or equivalent dependency
  - so you don't have to think as much about =x11/wayland= or =GTK/Qt= issues.
+ You can easily launch them from =waybar= with something like =alacritty -e sometui=

*** TODO explore/try these TUI's (and/or merge with the other list)
