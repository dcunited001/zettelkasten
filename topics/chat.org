+ Auth: uses SASL
  - CertFP requires SHA512
+ [[https://libera.chat/guides/sasl][Configure clients for network]]

*** OFTC
+ [[https://oftc.net/NickServ/CertFP/][Auth: uses CertFP]]
  - CertFP requires SHA1
+ [[https://chyen.cc/blog/posts/2020/10/17/irc-ecdsa-cert.html][Use ECDSA on OFTC]]
  - recommends =secp384r1=, which is a performant FIPS curve

* IRC Clients
** Weechat
Cool, but:

+ it clutters open my terminals
+ it's hard to open and the window manager can't easily manage it like an app (at least not without config)
+ there is a learning curve and it's not auto-discoverable
+ the configs make it hard to separate auth/secrets from configuration

** Quassel

*** Docs
+ [[https://libera.chat/guides/][Configure for networks]]


** KVIrc

This one I like, but:

+ it's not on Guix
+ same config isolation issues as weechat

* Discord
