#+title: Chat

We can't have nice things because "networks scale by the square of the nodes."
Almost every significant problem humanity faces can be traced back to network
theory. Easy to break, but expensive (or impossible) to fix.

| IRC | XMPP | Zoom | Discord | Meet | Jitsi | ...  |

Looking for a decent chat client supporting most of what's needed ... that
/doesn't/ require reading =m^2= guides where =m= is the number of services you
want to configure ... all before that one little thing means you're back to the
drawing board. Feedback or interactions with other people would help.

+ Thunderbird is probably a good way to go, but i haven't used it.

Most of the trusted extensions are maintained by one guy who no doubt uses emacs
-- ok maybe not, but you'd be surprised at how many solo "mythical man
maintainers" there are, regardless of their IDE/OS.

** Thunderbird (IRC)

** Weechat
Cool, but:

+ it clutters open my terminals
+ it's hard to open and the window manager can't easily manage it like an app (at least not without config)
+ there is a learning curve and it's not auto-discoverable
+ the configs make it hard to separate auth/secrets from configuration

This one I like, but:

+ it's not on Guix
+ same config isolation issues as weechat
