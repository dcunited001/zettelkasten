* IRC Clients
** Weechat
Cool, but:

+ it clutters open my terminals
+ it's hard to open and the window manager can't easily manage it like an app (at least not without config)
+ there is a learning curve and it's not auto-discoverable
+ the configs make it hard to separate auth/secrets from configuration

** Quassel

*** Docs
+ [[https://libera.chat/guides/][Configure for networks]]
+ [[nyxt:][quassel commandline tools]]

*** Topics

**** Quassel Core

***** Security

***** Running in Containers

***** Running with Postgres Backend

** KVIrc

This one I like, but:

+ it's not on Guix
+ same config isolation issues as weechat

* Discord
