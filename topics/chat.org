#+title: Chat

We can't have nice things because "networks scale by the square of the nodes."
Almost every significant problem humanity faces can be traced back to network
theory. Easy to break, but expensive (or impossible) to fix.

| IRC | XMPP | Zoom | Discord | Meet | Jitsi | ... |

Looking for a decent chat client supporting most of what's needed ... that
/doesn't/ require reading =m^2= guides where =m= is the number of services you
want to configure ... all before that one little thing means you're back to the
drawing board. Feedback or interactions with other people would help.

+ Thunderbird is probably a good way to go, but i haven't used it.

Most of the trusted extensions are maintained by one guy who no doubt uses emacs

** Thunderbird (IRC)

** Weechat
Cool, but:

+ it clutters open my terminals
+ it's hard to open and the window manager can't easily manage it like an app (at least not without config)
+ there is a learning curve and it's not auto-discoverable
+ the configs make it hard to separate auth/secrets from configuration

**** Data

Most of the application state (channels, server state, logs, etc) are in sqlite,
also within =XDG_CONFIG_HOME=

**** Review (2024)

I may look for a new chat. Quassel has a pretty great simple interface, but
its developers could really use some more support.

+ The quassel service can be multi-user and is effectively an IRC bridge
+ It supports either =sqlite3= or =postgresql= as a backend for logs/etc
+ There are even tools like =quasselgrep= for munging the logs.
+ The user interface is completely extensible via raw & standard CSS. There are
  a few good ones to sift through.
+ Supports all the SASL things you need (I think)

*** Issues

**** Wayland

***** Application menu

One issue (2024): in Wayland, the extensible application menu "thingy" doesn't
show up, which makes it impossible to access the settings. it affects many apps
in Wayland right now (including Firefox).

Copy your distro's =quassel.desktop= into =$HOME/.local/share/applications= and
then prepend =env QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb= to the ~Exec=~ invocation

#+begin_src sh
dtfile=quassel.desktop
dtpath=$HOME/.local/share/applications

# are these intended to not be programmable?
# cat $dtpath/$dtfile | tomlq 'keys'

# i mean i can imagine why..... but still

# soo... sed in place if you want
#+end_src


** KVIrc

This one I like, but:

+ it's not on Guix
+ same config isolation issues as weechat
