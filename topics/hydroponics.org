No idea what's autoritative in this field, but the data is generally useful:

+ Mulder's Charts: wish i had these for watering my own body
+ Conductivity (ÂµS) vs PPM (proportinal molarity): The conductivity here is the
  epiphenomenon to the phenomenon of molar concentrations of ions -- this is
  analogous to brain waves & regional ion concentrations
+ VPD: Vapor Pressure Deficit (plants strive for equilibrium)
