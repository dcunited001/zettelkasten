** As flatpak, japanese fonts are not included



*** These may help but didn't fix the core issue

+ Add the Japanese extension
+ Change the default fonts in preferences
+ Only some fonts are available
+ Change the settings in userChrome.css
  - this is described [[https://kb.mozillazine.org/Font_settings_in_Thunderbird#Thunderbird_user_interface][here]]
  - since this is CSS, listing the font after should allow it to fallthrough
