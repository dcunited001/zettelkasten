#+begin_quote
How the part should behave when it is changed
#+end_quote

+ Features should be labeled
  - Dynamic references can be highlighted (parent/child relationships)œß
+ Externally sourced parts (bolts/etc) should be swappable
+ Take manufacturing methods into account
  - even for dimensioning the prints: e.g. for a part made on a lathe, reference
    lengthwise dimensions from the from the side of the part machined first.
+ Dimensions usually preset in drawing templates
  - may also be set by Manufacturing Engineering Group
  - ultimately, set according to the machining equipment tolerances

Design for Manufacture

+ Tool changes, tool changes, tool changes
  - ensure consistent constraints on minimal radii across the model or across
    sections in the same toolpath

+ GD&T annotations.
  - solidwords addon to avoid drawings. manufacturer needs to support the data.
  - the addon can bundle the dimensions in the model to be shown as views.

+ Collision detection, Tolerance checks
