** Image Stitching

This [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSRUOIAydaI&t=600s][video about Merlin]] is a bit weird, but has a fascinating video effect that
seems to be based on image stitching across time. It is perhaps using lower
level computer vision features to cause segments of the image to appear to move
at different rates of time. The effect takes into account the Sobel filter
(contrast map) and benefits from the lighting used in the video, the latter of
which causes sharp edges (of either columns or skulls) and noise patterns (from
surface textures) to be relatively preserved in the rendered 2D image space. The
effect is first clearly understood when you see that the smoke @10:00 is moving
backwards.

The red stitching in this image connect points where there is minimal change in
the overlapping images. If you imagine a 3D stack of video frames moving through
time (in other words, 2,1 spacetime), the video effect is doing something where
you have analogous image regions that are segmented in a similar way. The
regions where there are minimal changes seem to be preserved across time.
