+ pacreport :: track unowned files (from pacutils)
** Updating stale AUR-git packages
* Garuda
** Dock
*** Plasma Dock replaced Latte Dock
Latte UI/UX was great, but the project really needed some love. Diffing configs
was tough. Lots of dynamic changes.

Garuda replaced this with Plasma Dock. The configs were a bit tough to
find. Most garuda configs have been moved outside of =/etc/skel/= and the
scripts to create the dock are now in
[[/usr/share/plasma/look-and-feel/Dr460nized/contents/layouts/org.kde.plasma.desktop-layout.js]]


** Podman
*** processing tar file(potentially insufficient UIDs or GIDs available in user namespace...)

+ Rootless Podman not configured properly (see [[https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12715][containers/podman#12715]])
  - follow instructions in [[https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman.1.html#rootless-mode][podman docs]] (may not be sufficient)
  - restart podman service and attempt pulling image

** Misc
+ shadow-verify service fails bc ntp
  - NTP service moved to systemd-timesyncd from ntpd
  - ensure /var/lib/ntp is gone
  - remove ntp user if necessary
