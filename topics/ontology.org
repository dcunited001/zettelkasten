** Semantic Web
The semantic web project from W3C developes several [mostly] XML-based standards
defining meta-schema that form the basis for data/information classification.
With OWL, RFC, SKOL, etc, any data can be classified to fit into an ontological
schema. SPARQL is used to query data structured according to OWL/RFC/SKOL schema
docs.
