#+TITLE: PFSense and OPNSense
#+DESCRIPTION: The Firewall
#+TAGS:

Being kind of an idiot ... it's a bit hard to distinguish these two things. The
commit frequency charts are misleading. They look about the same ... but when
the red correlates strongly to the green -- that's a refactor. You can't scale
the Github charts, so it's a bit hard to judge the activity on either.

Hardened BSD Kernel sounds sexy and all, but ... migrate my firewall for a
plugin? Nope. Still, this is perhaps just a [[https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/blob/dev/LICENSE.txt][sad, sad casualty of licensing]] (BSL).

By the way, Github, a more useful chart on some projects would identify the
anti-correlation between positive/negative Commit SLOC and then subtract the
scaled magnitude of SLOC anticorrelation from the signal. The difficulties:
finding a window function to run on any arbitrary repository and also deciding
how to renormalize the anticorrelated signal. I think that's what
anticorrelation is for. Not really a practical feature though...

*** Terminal

Setting your terminal to something funny like =TERM=alacritty= before =ssh= will
prevent you from editing files ... though I'm not sure why I set my term to
that.

*** FreeBSD Packages

**** Quirks

+ Requires login/logout after installing for bin's to be found in path.
+ Enable emacs shortcuts in terminal by using =sh=, but I'd rather not.

**** GNU Screen

=pkg install screen=

This one is recommended by the docs as an example ... it has no dependencies.


**** Pkg Repos

Man is not included (is this foreshadowing?)



***** TLDR:

I should probably finish reading the cheatsheet: =pkg config REPOS_DIR=

/etc/pkg/
/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/
#+end_quote

In which case, we see the content

***** Adding the pfsense/FreeBSD-Ports repo

One potential solution is here [[https://forum.netgate.com/topic/130832/solution-posted-dns-tls-getdns-stubby-from-pfsense-freebsd-ports][getdns-stubby-from-pfsense-freebsd-ports]] (2018)
but it's hard to validate whether running stuff like =pkg install git= will
result in a stable system. The package dependencies seem to match the system
... for now, but they definitely overlap.

... it seems that =pkg install git= is safe-ish: [[https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/development/gitsync.html?highlight=pkg%20git#troubleshooting][Using gitsync [to update PHP

***** Trying to find pkg.conf

There is =/etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf=, but it looks like nothing's there and it tells
you to enable the wrong repository.

#+begin_quote
[2.6.0-RELEASE][user@pf.com]/root: find /etc/ -type f -exec grep -re  "FreeBSD-ports" \{\} +

#+end_quote

Tracing the =pkg-utils.inc= leads to these maintainance scripts, so it looks
like I already have the repository, but it's just not enabled by a config
file. I already tried searching =/tmp= ... since I've scripted DDWRT by =nvram=
before I know how runtime state is setup there.

  from the pfsense/FreeBSD-ports repository? They say [[https://forum.netgate.com/topic/174951/pfsense-pkg-from-freebsd-ports-or-repo/11][don't do it]], but I already
  figured that out.

*** Ansible Collections
Yay [[https://galaxy.ansible.com/pfsensible/core][declarative configuration]]

.... i can haz declarative configuration? Well technically it's just XML, but
you don't see any that in the manual because too risky for business model. So
now it's realllly risky. It beats the hell out of MikroTik or so I've heard, but
if you're willing to reconsider, I'd like to introduce you to my friends
=Ctrl-F= and =libxml2=.

Sorry if my criticism sounds harsh, but trying to manage the firewall is verrry
slow in the GUI. Also, my working memory does not get along with 24 browser
tabs. Nice GUI though. The features are nice, but it's hard to experiment with
them while controlling variables if you can't diff configs, grok config
changesets or script things easily.

I guess I just don't know enough BSD. I did customize the shell prompt though.

*** ZeroTier on PFSense

Now that I'm really getting into this ... it would be difficult to control
access if ZeroTier isn't coming through the front door.

According to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/tskpkl/official_zerotier_pfsense_package/][r/PFSense]], this feature isn't being implemented, while being
available on OPNSense. There are mentions of [[https://github.com/ChanceM/pfSense-pkg-zerotier][ChanceM/pfSense-pkg-zerotier]], a
custom package implementing the FreeBSD ZeroTier 1.8.6, but it doesn't seem to
be very active.

However, there are [[https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apfsense%2FFreeBSD-ports+zerotier&type=commits][recent commits]] to PFSense indicating the package is coming
(1.10+), but it requires installing directly from the [[https://github.com/pfsense/FreeBSD-ports/blob/main/net/zerotier/Makefile][FreeBSD "ports tree"]]. The
main difference here is that the custom package modifies the PHP and installs as
a bundle ... while also being incompatible with the fresh ports version.

The OPNSense package, which sources an older ZeroTier package comes with this
[[https://github.com/opnsense/ports/blob/87bbf9d6d93faceee98816de7f86989405f323d5/net/zerotier/pkg-message#L16-L23][important caveat]] addressing a potential race condition, which is mentioned as a
problem for the custom PFSense package. The following "sysctl" should be enabled
=net.link.tap.up_on_open=1= to address the problem (on OPNSense)
