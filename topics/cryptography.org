** Topics
*** Config Quirks
**** Portability

To make the configs portable, I need a link from =~/.ssh= to
=${SSH_CONFIG_HOME}=. Includes can't use =${SSH_CONFIG_HOME}=, but
IdentityFile can.

GPG Agent may handle this differently, since it uses keygrips.

***** Dealing with =ssh_config= path expansion

+ ssh uses tilde, not =HOME=
+ Links are inconvenient, since a computer will often have a =~/.ssh=
  directory. This will need to be (re)moved.

***** IdentityFile

+ Does not resolve relative paths like =Include=. instead, it expects these to
  be relative to =pwd=
+ If =HOME= variable is set, ssh_config still expands tilde to the
  user's home directory.

***** Include

+ Cannot expand =${SSH_CONFIG_HOME}= directives
+ Can follow Match or Host directives
+ Relative paths will always be relative to:
  - =~/.ssh/=
  - =/etc/ssh/=
  - changing =HOME= has no effect
+ May end up included in an Host directive if at end of file
  - instead add after a =Match all=
+ Does not permit any =%.= expansion

*** Config Defaults

Use =ssh -G $host= to print the interpreted configuration for host. e.g.

#+begin_src shell :results output verbatim :wrap example diff
diff <(ssh -G te.xel.io) <(ssh -G github.com)
#+end_src

*** PCKS11

**** Specifying a link to the PKCS#11 lib

The =ssh-agent= expects libs to be one of two default locations, but both this and
=ssh-add= will resolve links that are passed, so they must be exact.

On Guix, this requires setting up =ssh-agent= to point to the exact
=opensc-pkcs11.so= with =ssh-agent -s -P $(readlink $PKCS_LIB)=.

When tracing problems, then run as foreground daemon with =-d=.

Then card-keys should now add when running =ssh-add -s "$(readlink $PKCS_LIB)"=

Because ssh will use a similar interface that resolves links, then adding
=PCKS11Provider /run/current-system/profile/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so= to the
=ssh_config= will reach the correct bin from a link. No need to update the config
(phew!).

For this specific link to work, the =opensc= package must be installed to the Guix
/system/.

**** Scripts

#+begin_src sh :tangle (concat secrets-home "/.ssh/agent_rc") :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
export PKCS_LIB=/run/current-system/profile/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so

alias pkcs-agent='ssh-agent -s -P $(readlink $PKCS_LIB)'
#alias pkcs-add='ssh-add -s $(readlink $PKCS_LIB)' #readlink not necessary
alias pkcs-add='ssh-add -s $PKCS_LIB'
alias pkcs-ssh='ssh -I $PKCS_LIB'
#+end_src

*** SSH =JumpProxy= and =ProxyCommand=

Okay wow this is a thing now. Nice to know.
*** SSH Agent Forwarding

+ [[https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/92479/security-of-nested-ssh][Security of Nested SSH]]: Why not using agent forwarding might be a bad idea
+ [[Why using SSH agent-forwarding is a Bad Idea][Why using SSH Agent Forwarding is a bad idea]]: also explains

*** Canonicalization

The following options affect how DNS names specified in =ssh_config= are either
rewritten or redirected via CNAME's. The =ProxyJump= method needs to be aware of
an available DNS host you want to connect to (e.g. it won't have access to IP's
in hosts configured in your local =/etc/hosts=.

+ CanonicalDomains :: Restrict =CanonicalizeHostname= to these upper-level
  domains.
+ CanonicalizeFallbackLocal  ::
+ CanonicalizeMaxDots (1) :: These are processed from the left. The =man
  ssh_config= says: "The default, 1, allows a single dot: hostname.subdomain..."
+ CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs (none) :: rules DNS names with CNAME redirects
+ CanonicalizeHostname (no) :: set to =always= to canonicalize the
  jumped-to-host when using =ProxyJump=.
  - I believe this means the local ssh does the CNAME lookup/rewrite before any
    connection and thus the request to proxy sent to the the jump-host is
    encapsulated as canonicalized.

**** Configure Why?

This mainly helps you ensure that your delegated SSH connections are taking the
right path to reach the right host. Like when:

+ A DNS name resolves to a different IP address outside the internal network
+ A firewall would reject your connection if your traffic takes the wrong route
+ Or a load-balancer would behave differently when forwarding your connections'
  traffic depending on the DNS name.

This would be relevant for:

+ Hardening SSH connections against DNS-based MitM attacks, somewhat
+ Working on networks with split-horizon DNS, the internal records for which are
  not usually publicly available outside the network.
+ When Hairpin NAT does Hairpin NAT things (or so I've heard)
+ Relying on port-forwarding, while ensure connection is redirected to an
  internally available hostname.
+ Ensuring the ProxyJump is jumping you to the right host and taking the
  expected path.
+ You're on a VPN, but you don't have DNS configured right on your local host
  (or maybe it is... since this relies on DNS)
+ You want to connect to specific server doing "GeoIP things" or that is
  abstracted behind a VIP -- [[https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/expand-the-edge][global anycast, regional anycast, unicast]] -- but
  you want to connect to it using the public-facing DNS name it expects (maybe
  this describes a rational or valid situation... maybe not)

See [[https://sleeplessbeastie.eu/2020/08/24/how-to-perform-hostname-canonicalization/][this blog]] for a walkthrough.

The minimum configuration is something like:

#+begin_example ssh-config
CanonicalizeHostname yes
CanonicalDomains example.org example.com
#+end_example

Another example from the blog would work (I think...) when =*.redis.example.org=
would take send your traffic outside the network or hit a load-balancer with the
invalid parameters.

#+begin_example ssh-config
CanonicalizeHostname yes
CanonicalDomains example.org example.com
CanonicalizeMaxDots 1
CanonicalizeFallbackLocal yes
CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs *.redis.example.org:redis.internal.example.com
#+end_example

*** Cross Signing

I'm mainly looking for answers to a following questions ... but more generally:
when does the whole "someone got the key for your CA so now they can sign
anything they want" thing matter?

+ How does a signing CA implement rules for restricted SAN's when signing Certs
  & CA's?
+ How do clients interpret that these rules were adhered to for certs signed by
  Intermediate CA's? If the metadata that defines these SAN restrictions is
  contained on the Intermediate CA's cert, then when a client validates a chain
  not containing that cert, it has no idea they're supposed to be there --
  unless it gets the full chain from the server. This may not happen for every
  =(app, server)= pair or for every =(client, application)= pair

**** Hashicorp has a guide to [[https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/secrets-management/pki-engine][Build Your Own Certificate Authority]].

This documents what i'm looking for, but I can't clearly elucidate it by
analyzing the example certs with =certtool -i < /tmp/cross-ica.crt=. (still no
answer)

Also, isn't this supposed to include more constraints on what should be signed?

*** Certification Path Validation

**** Per Client Library

This video (and assoc. content) clarifies handling details for validation by
several client libraries. It's a bit dated (2018), but covers a lot of ground.

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQx2OhzFO0][Revisiting the X.509 Certification Path Validation (Dr. Falko Strenzke)]]
+ [[github:mtg-ag/cpt][mtg-ag/cpt]] x.509 conformance test suite (and a [[https://cryptosource.de/blogpost__cpt_en.html][blog]] about it with slides/etc)
+ The [[https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Informationen-und-Empfehlungen/Kryptografie/Certification-Path-Validation-Test-Tool/certification-path-validation-test-tool.html][docs]] on the bundewatsitheit site

AFAIK, any specific issues depend on:

+ how an implementation validates CSRs (& PKI interactions with CA/RA etc)
+ how the software for each client/server perform validation

so if a library doesn't process extensions or attributes correctly, it may
sign/accept/reject/skip, but then client or server software may reject/report.

** Cloud

See [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.3.4][RFC 8555 section on EAB]], which "associates an ACME account with an existing
account in a non-ACME system, such as a CA customer database."

*** GCP

Certificate Manager: [[https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/overview][overview]]

+ See [[https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/overview#limitations][limitations]]: this only creates certs to be deployed to GCP products. Other
  certs can be uploaded, but it mostly manages certs deployed to LB's and
  Proxies (the things I can't afford)

[[https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/reference/public-ca/rest][Public Certificate Authority API]]

+ The ACME client must support EAB
+ Google-provided client libs are recommended

*** AWS


** Certmagic

Caddy's [[https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https][automagic TLS features]]. By default it will use =HTTP-01= and
=TLS-ALPN-01= at random, unless they're disabled. It can use =DNS-01= as well.

*** Resources

**** Backends

**** Wildcard Certs

This is probably noted in another zettel specifically on wildcard certs, but
Let's Encrypt /only/ allows =DNS-01= challenges for these -- which must be why I
haven't considered any of the other methods until I figured out what
=TLS-ALPN-01= is.

***** Damit

I can't ever do the research /AND/ complete something quickly enough for the
information to be ready-at-hand ... which means I can't easily repeat what I've
almost completed in order to reinforce it.

Thanks a lot for assassinating my career, America. I'm sure I'll forget about it
sometime soon. What's wrong with this combinatorial explosion right here?

robbed of $500,000 in income and that's me being reasonable about it.
