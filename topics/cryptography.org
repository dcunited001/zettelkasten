*** Config Quirks
**** Portability

To make the configs portable, I need a link from =~/.ssh= to
=${SSH_CONFIG_HOME}=. Includes can't use =${SSH_CONFIG_HOME}=, but
IdentityFile can.

GPG Agent may handle this differently, since it uses keygrips.

***** Dealing with =ssh_config= path expansion

+ ssh uses tilde, not =HOME=
+ Links are inconvenient, since a computer will often have a =~/.ssh=
  directory. This will need to be (re)moved.

***** IdentityFile

+ Does not resolve relative paths like =Include=. instead, it expects these to
  be relative to =pwd=
+ If =HOME= variable is set, ssh_config still expands tilde to the
  user's home directory.

***** Include

+ Cannot expand =${SSH_CONFIG_HOME}= directives
+ Can follow Match or Host directives
+ Relative paths will always be relative to:
  - =~/.ssh/=
  - =/etc/ssh/=
  - changing =HOME= has no effect
+ May end up included in an Host directive if at end of file
  - instead add after a =Match all=
+ Does not permit any =%.= expansion

*** Config Defaults

Use =ssh -G $host= to print the interpreted configuration for host. e.g.

*** PCKS11

**** Specifying a link to the PKCS#11 lib

The =ssh-agent= expects libs to be one of two default locations, but both this and
=ssh-add= will resolve links that are passed, so they must be exact.

On Guix, this requires setting up =ssh-agent= to point to the exact
=opensc-pkcs11.so= with =ssh-agent -s -P $(readlink $PKCS_LIB)=.

When tracing problems, then run as foreground daemon with =-d=.

Then card-keys should now add when running =ssh-add -s "$(readlink $PKCS_LIB)"=

Because ssh will use a similar interface that resolves links, then adding
=PCKS11Provider /run/current-system/profile/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so= to the
=ssh_config= will reach the correct bin from a link. No need to update the config
(phew!).

For this specific link to work, the =opensc= package must be installed to the Guix
/system/.

**** Scripts

#+begin_src sh :tangle (concat secrets-home "/.ssh/agent_rc") :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
export PKCS_LIB=/run/current-system/profile/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so

alias pkcs-agent='ssh-agent -s -P $(readlink $PKCS_LIB)'
#alias pkcs-add='ssh-add -s $(readlink $PKCS_LIB)' #readlink not necessary
alias pkcs-add='ssh-add -s $PKCS_LIB'
alias pkcs-ssh='ssh -I $PKCS_LIB'
#+end_src

*** Known Hosts

**** Unsalt

You need the input string

#+begin_src shell :results output verbatim :var host="github.com"
sshHostsUngunk() {
    local host=$1
    shift 1
    ssh-keygen -F "$host" | grep -ve '^#' | cut -b4- | tr '|' ' '
}

b64salt=$(sshHostsUngunk $host | cut -f1 -d' ')
b64hash=$(sshHostsUngunk $host | cut -f2 -d' ')
echo $b64salt | base64 -d | wc -c
echo $b64salt
echo $b64hash | base64 -d | wc -c
echo $b64hash

cat <(echo -n $host) \
    <(sshHostsUngunk $host | cut -f1 -d' ' | base64 --decode) \
    | sha1sum | base64

hmmmm... it eats a salt and some bytes? or some bytes and then the salt? manpage
doesn't explain... although I guess I'm missing the HMAC key, but =sha1= lacks
that. is it padding or encoding or dropped bytes?

**** Reset

To reset known hosts

+ =ssh-keygen -F $hostOrIp= to find it
+ =ssh-keygen -R $hostOrIp= to remove it
*** SSH =JumpProxy= and =ProxyCommand=

Okay wow this is a thing now. Nice to know.
*** SSH Agent Forwarding

+ [[https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/92479/security-of-nested-ssh][Security of Nested SSH]]: Why not using agent forwarding might be a bad idea
+ [[Why using SSH agent-forwarding is a Bad Idea][Why using SSH Agent Forwarding is a bad idea]]: also explains

*** Canonicalization

The following options affect how DNS names specified in =ssh_config= are either
rewritten or redirected via CNAME's. The =ProxyJump= method needs to be aware of
an available DNS host you want to connect to (e.g. it won't have access to IP's
in hosts configured in your local =/etc/hosts=.

+ CanonicalDomains :: Restrict =CanonicalizeHostname= to these upper-level
  domains.
+ CanonicalizeFallbackLocal  ::
+ CanonicalizeMaxDots (1) :: These are processed from the left. The =man
  ssh_config= says: "The default, 1, allows a single dot: hostname.subdomain..."
+ CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs (none) :: rules DNS names with CNAME redirects
+ CanonicalizeHostname (no) :: set to =always= to canonicalize the
  jumped-to-host when using =ProxyJump=.
  - I believe this means the local ssh does the CNAME lookup/rewrite before any
    connection and thus the request to proxy sent to the the jump-host is
    encapsulated as canonicalized.

**** Configure Why?

This mainly helps you ensure that your delegated SSH connections are taking the
right path to reach the right host. Like when:

+ A DNS name resolves to a different IP address outside the internal network
+ A firewall would reject your connection if your traffic takes the wrong route
+ Or a load-balancer would behave differently when forwarding your connections'
  traffic depending on the DNS name.

This would be relevant for:

+ Hardening SSH connections against DNS-based MitM attacks, somewhat
+ Working on networks with split-horizon DNS, the internal records for which are
  not usually publicly available outside the network.
+ When Hairpin NAT does Hairpin NAT things (or so I've heard)
+ Relying on port-forwarding, while ensure connection is redirected to an
  internally available hostname.
+ Ensuring the ProxyJump is jumping you to the right host and taking the
  expected path.
+ You're on a VPN, but you don't have DNS configured right on your local host
  (or maybe it is... since this relies on DNS)
+ You want to connect to specific server doing "GeoIP things" or that is
  abstracted behind a VIP -- [[https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/expand-the-edge][global anycast, regional anycast, unicast]] -- but
  you want to connect to it using the public-facing DNS name it expects (maybe
  this describes a rational or valid situation... maybe not)

See [[https://sleeplessbeastie.eu/2020/08/24/how-to-perform-hostname-canonicalization/][this blog]] for a walkthrough.

The minimum configuration is something like:

#+begin_example ssh-config
CanonicalizeHostname yes
CanonicalDomains example.org example.com
#+end_example

Another example from the blog would work (I think...) when =*.redis.example.org=
would take send your traffic outside the network or hit a load-balancer with the
invalid parameters.

#+begin_example ssh-config
CanonicalizeHostname yes
CanonicalDomains example.org example.com
CanonicalizeMaxDots 1
CanonicalizeFallbackLocal yes
CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs *.redis.example.org:redis.internal.example.com
#+end_example

*** Compatibility in Session Negotiation

I'm confused as to the specificity of KEX algorithms or other features. It's
pretty clear the algorithms need to be the same (not RSA/X25519).

+ Github has some MAC/Cipher/KEX offers that my clients accept
  - Using SSH-via-GPG with X25519 authentication subkey on yubikey openpgp
+ Yet, my =~/.ssh/config='s entry from my laptop to my desktop can't complete.
  - It gets rejected right as =scdaemon= goes to ask the key to sign. I'm not sure
    it's =scdaemon= or =pscsd= though.
  - It's not something that =ssh= or =gpg-agent= catches in validation
  - pinentry doesn't show for that server

I've checked basic compatibility. There are a few additional algo's I enabled
for Github and other forges when I encountered a similar issue ... Probably the
last time i rotated keys? Or maybe after a reinstall.

+ ..... and for some reason now it works from NixOS -> Omarchy, but not the
  other way.

**** GPG and SSH Config

Used drduh's guide to configure the key. There are new subkeys on the card.

+ Systemd initializes GPG.
+ =pinentry-qt= always pops up for decrypt and sign. PIN cache doesn't seem to
  affect the functionality. pinentry shows for auth key when connecting to
  github

**** Checking SSH Configs

#+begin_src shell

alias sshCaps='for q in cipher cipher-auth mac kex key key-ca-sign key-cert key-plain protocol-version sig; do echo; echo "### $q"; echo; ssh -Q $q | sort; done'
#+end_src

+ Tried checking client caps... they're the same.
+ The NixOS system supports sets =gssapi= off for host configs by default. They're
  otherwise the same.
+ Arch has kerberos/gssapi settings in sshd, but most other configs are the same
+ Only key difference (no punning around) was the lack of an
  =/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa= on my desktop... but it's never been there.

+ on the laptop: pcscd shows =LIBUSB_ERROR_NO_DEVICE= when using the yubikey 5ci
  that has the new subkeys (this may be when I pull the device out)
+ both yubikeys have firmware 5.4.2. =dmesg= seems normal when I plug them in.x
+ pcscd version: desktop 2.3.0, laptop 2.4.0. This may be the issue ...

To grok =APDU= and =SW= responses for OpenPGP, see 7.1 and 7.9 of
[[https://gnupg.org/ftp/specs/OpenPGP-smart-card-application-3.4.1.pdf][openpgp-card-3.4.1.pdf]]

**** Checking =pcscd= logs

The only difference for APDUs in the the server I can connect to (github) are
the following. Everything leading up to that is the same. It's like =pscsd= (or
=scdaemon= driving it) get ready to ask for the pin, but never do (APDU 00 20)

With this command...

#+begin_src shell
diff <(cat $d/sshgithub.txt | grep -E '[\[0-9\]{16}].*(APDU: 00) ' | sed 's/.*APDU/APDU/') \
    <(cat $d/sshmyhost.txt | grep -E '[\[0-9\]{16}].*(APDU: 00) ' | sed 's/.*APDU/APDU/')
#+end_src

I'm seeing the same APDUs up to here.

=APDU: 00 A4 04 00 06 <openpgp>= is preceded by some of the same, but these may be
extended APDUs.

#+begin_example
+ APDU: 00 A4 04 00 06 <openpgp>
+ APDU: 00 CA 00 C4 00
+ APDU: 00 CA 00 65 00
+ APDU: 00 CA 00 F9 00
+ APDU: 00 20 00 82 20 <pin>
+ APDU: 00 20 00 81 20 <pin>
+ APDU: 00 88 00 00 1A <authinput>
+ APDU: 00 C0 00 00 35
#+end_example

I considered submitting a bug to =pcsclite= but it requires uploading full logs.

+ if the pcscd version is the issue then interactions using the same firmware
  version should proceed normally
  - unless 2.4.0 =APDU= messages are calling some functionality the card doesn't
    implement (or if there are other issues, but these should exhibit)
  - if pcscd 2.4.0 uses different methods to assemble its encoded commands to
    the device (APU stuff; and it does), then maybe this change doesn't break
    utilization of smartcard OpenPGP app for RSA ... but does for ed25519.
  - Nixos may have rolled back bc pcscd 2.5.0 was definitely not going to work
    with =step-kms= _IF_ I ran it inside a =guix-shell=. (holy fuck so confusing)

**** Checking scdaemon logs

I've tried everything up to =scdaemon --debug-all= I haven't tried debugging
=gpg-agent= yet. =scdaemon= shows basically the same info as =pcscd=

***** Journal Logs

I noticed this in my logs

Neither =scdaemon= nor =pcscd= note that an error is occurring. Here, only gpg-agent
seems to be aware.

**** Host Keys

Discovered one issue via SSH from =laptop -> itself=. something was silently
rejecting the host key.

+ The old entry was =ssh-ed25519=. I deleted it. Couldn't SSH before.
+ There are many entries for this key's fingerprint in =~/.ssh/known_hosts=
+ Then SSH could connect. Omarchy selects a =ecdsa-sha2-nistp256=, which is
  appended to =known_hosts=, but no other entries have that fingerprint.
+ This didn't seem to fix =laptop -> desktop= though....

**** Key Exchange

+ Github is selecting =kex: host key algorithm: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256=
+ Laptop (to itself): =kex: host key algorithm: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256=
+ My desktop is selecting =kex: host key algorithm: rsa-sha2-512=
  - ECDSA server keys aren't available. this is more of a host keys thing...

**** Host Keys (again)

+ I needed to be pedantic when specifying algorithms in =~/.ssh/config.any= ...
  but I didn't recognize =ed25519=, so I left it out of =HostKeyAlgorithms=
+ I did something similar in =/etc/ssh/sshd_config= for nixos, so this needed to
  be fixed in both places (=ed25519= was in =/etc/ssh/sshd_config= on omarchy)

Priorities in =sshd_config= (and =ssh_config= for my systems)

|-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------|
| old nixos                     | new nixos                     | defaults                      |
|-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------|
| rsa > ecdsa                   | ed25519 > rsa > ecdsa         | ecdsa > ed25519 > rsa         |
| key > sk-key > cert > sk-cert | cert > sk-cert > key > sk-key | cert > sk-cert > key > sk-key |
|-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------|
So then, after fixing that, it works, but the defaults for arch =sshd= aren't
great. noticiing was how I go went down this road.

Changing the order in =sshd= changes algorithm selection when connecting

+ Notice how this almost _never_ changes for most services. may be
  confirmation-bias from lack of experience.
  - though for cert-based auth, it's less of a problem? idk
  - if the =VerifyHostKeyDNS= is set or if cert-based auth matches, I think it
    updates trust.
+ coordinating this requires precision. Otherwise, automation *breaks* and you log
  in on weekends or whatever.

#+begin_quote
NO ONE I KNOW EVER TALKS ABOUT IT. Of course, I never sit down at a computer
with anyone else. For homelab stuff, this just doesn't come up. It's relevant
once:

+ your networks' scale induces an annoying coordination problem that forces you
  to question whether it's the actual host
+ your automations fail when you swapped out VM Hosts
+ "It actually was DNS." which shouldn't be too much of a problem. if there's
  load-balancing on ssh (?) maybe.
+ you're using cloud-config (and probably not with AWS/GCP/Azure: that's someone
  else's job)

in my life people have only rarely hinted at these =known_hosts= issues bc it
implies experience -- or total lack thereof. It's a reasonable litmus ... but
yeh. chances are that someone points this out while you're in college, but 95%
of the time, you won't appreciate it until later. my family's idea that i'm
lacking a college degree is infuriating. i lack a society that is anything other
than effectively hostile. no? how much time have I spent in the last 10 years
looking at someone else's screen while they program. probably like < 5 hours,
even when working at "jobs" on "teams"

*** DANE+DNSSEC

By adding =TLSA= records to your domain (with DNSSEC), this provides you with a
bit of flexibility when bootstrapping or migrating PKI. You can establish
trusted certificates in DNS

*** PKCS#7
**** Graph from =p7b=

Find a nice big =PKCS#7= file from somewhere and run this to get valid yaml with
an array of partial =cert_info= objects

#+begin_src shell
openssl pkcs7 -print -in $t/big.p7b \
    | grep -A5 -E '(cert_info:\|issuer:\|subject:)' \
    | grep -ve '^--' \
    | sed -e 's/^      //g' \
    | sed -e 's/^  cert_info:/- cert_info:/g'

It should be possible to reconstitute the graph using the =DN + Serial=, but the
=IssuerUID= may be another route.

*** Cross Signing

I'm mainly looking for answers to a following questions ... but more generally:
when does the whole "someone got the key for your CA so now they can sign
anything they want" thing matter?

+ How does a signing CA implement rules for restricted SAN's when signing Certs
  & CA's?
+ How do clients interpret that these rules were adhered to for certs signed by
  Intermediate CA's? If the metadata that defines these SAN restrictions is
  contained on the Intermediate CA's cert, then when a client validates a chain
  not containing that cert, it has no idea they're supposed to be there --
  unless it gets the full chain from the server. This may not happen for every
  =(app, server)= pair or for every =(client, application)= pair

**** Hashicorp has a guide to [[https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/secrets-management/pki-engine][Build Your Own Certificate Authority]].

This documents what i'm looking for, but I can't clearly elucidate it by
analyzing the example certs with =certtool -i < /tmp/cross-ica.crt=. (still no
answer)

Also, isn't this supposed to include more constraints on what should be signed?

*** Certification Path Validation

**** Per Client Library

This video (and assoc. content) clarifies handling details for validation by
several client libraries. It's a bit dated (2018), but covers a lot of ground.

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQx2OhzFO0][Revisiting the X.509 Certification Path Validation (Dr. Falko Strenzke)]]
+ [[github:mtg-ag/cpt][mtg-ag/cpt]] x.509 conformance test suite (and a [[https://cryptosource.de/blogpost__cpt_en.html][blog]] about it with slides/etc)
+ The [[https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Informationen-und-Empfehlungen/Kryptografie/Certification-Path-Validation-Test-Tool/certification-path-validation-test-tool.html][docs]] on the bundewatsitheit site

AFAIK, any specific issues depend on:

+ how an implementation validates CSRs (& PKI interactions with CA/RA etc)
+ how the software for each client/server perform validation

so if a library doesn't process extensions or attributes correctly, it may
sign/accept/reject/skip, but then client or server software may reject/report.

** Cloud

See [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.3.4][RFC 8555 section on EAB]], which "associates an ACME account with an existing
account in a non-ACME system, such as a CA customer database."

*** GCP

Certificate Manager: [[https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/overview][overview]]

+ See [[https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/overview#limitations][limitations]]: this only creates certs to be deployed to GCP products. Other
  certs can be uploaded, but it mostly manages certs deployed to LB's and
  Proxies (the things I can't afford)

[[https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/reference/public-ca/rest][Public Certificate Authority API]]

+ The ACME client must support EAB
+ Google-provided client libs are recommended

*** AWS


** Certmagic

Caddy's [[https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https][automagic TLS features]]. By default it will use =HTTP-01= and
=TLS-ALPN-01= at random, unless they're disabled. It can use =DNS-01= as well.

*** Resources

**** Backends

+ [[github:grafana/certmagic-gcs][grafana/certmagic-gcs]] this does offer to encrypt the secrets it stores
+ [[github:trea/caddy-gcp-secret-manager][trea/caddy-gcp-secret-manager]] few stars, four commits and I don't know go

** Let's Encrypt

*** Docs
+ [[https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/dns-providers-who-easily-integrate-with-lets-encrypt-dns-validation/86438][Let's Encrypt offerings by DNS provider]]

*** Resources


*** Topics

**** TLS-ALPN-01

+ via [[https://caddy.community/t/caddy-supports-the-acme-tls-alpn-challenge/4860][caddy]]

**** Wildcard Certs

This is probably noted in another zettel specifically on wildcard certs, but
Let's Encrypt /only/ allows =DNS-01= challenges for these -- which must be why I
haven't considered any of the other methods until I figured out what
=TLS-ALPN-01= is.

***** Damit

I can't ever do the research /AND/ complete something quickly enough for the
information to be ready-at-hand ... which means I can't easily repeat what I've
almost completed in order to reinforce it.

Thanks a lot for assassinating my career, America. I'm sure I'll forget about it
sometime soon. What's wrong with this combinatorial explosion right here?

Dealing with all that is much easier when:

Wow I must be so incompetent. No wonder I have zero social connections. What do
those do anyways? Nope, if I didn't search it on Google or read it in a source
repository or see it on a youtube video, it doesn't exist to me. I've been
robbed of $500,000 in income and that's me being reasonable about it.
