*** Tubular Herbs

Turmeric & Ginseng are perennial rhizomes that, in the wild, grow for fairly
long periods of time. Turmeric gets harvested annually, but Ginseng takes
longer. idrk.

How do variation in the above affect expression of genetic programs in plants? I
imagine that perenials have more:

+ chromosomes with more chromatin remodeling
+ promotors/inhibitors for genetic tuning
+ range in epigenetic expression

Variety in chemistry is probably a weak proxy for complexity of genetic
programs... but idk
