* Languages

** R

** Matlab

** Julia

Works quite a lot better if you figure out how to forego python dependencies
(e.g. use Flux.jl instead of tensorflow/etc). It's amazing how few lines you can
implement a simple gradient descent problem in.

*** Flux.jl

+ Flux.jl example  [[id:3a7412c7-f75b-4772-85d9-015da383efbc][Attempt to solve a statics problem with Flux.jl]]

* Frameworks

** Torch

** Tensorflow
*** Resources
+ [[https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c][C API]] intended to link from other languages

**** [[https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples][C/C++ Examples]]

[[https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/custom_ops_doc][Custom Ops Doc]]: more complete examples (CPU, GPU, Sparse)


*** Topics
+ [[https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/sparse_tensor][Sparse Tensors]]
+ [[https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/dtensor_overview][DTensors]] ... okay yeh, probably not going to be using that :(

[[https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/random_numbers][Streaming Random Number Generation]] ... yeh I basically got 5150'd to a
short-term mental health facility for talking about planning to do this in WebGL
(more or less...) see [[https://te.xel.io/graphics/2017-01-04-webgl-gpu-prng.html][A Terrible GPU PRNG With WebGL]] ... it's cool, it's totally
cool, i'm totally fine with that.

**** Keras
The high-level layers API, more or less.

**** Datasets [[github:tensorflow/datasets][tensorflow/datasets]]

Both of these are defined in =./tensorflow_datasets/core/load.py=:

+ tfds.builder :: fetch a =tfds.core.DatasetBuilder= by name
+ tfds.load :: convenience method to construct a builder, download the data, and
  create an input pipeline, returning a =tf.data.Dataset=

**** Distributed TF

+ [[https://github.com/yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark/wiki/Conversion-Guide][Converting a TF model]] to run on [[github:yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark][yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark]]

* Docker Images

** AMD [[https://hub.docker.com/u/rocm][ROCm]]

I think I need /both/ pytorch /and/ tensorflow on a Jupyter image. Otherwise,
I'mma stop and start that shit every five seconds. It is what it is.

*** [[https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch][rocm/pytorch]]

The Dockerfile for rocm/pytorch:latest should set the =PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=
variable. There are no code references for this variable in the
[[github:ROCmSoftwarePlatform/pytorch][ROCmSoftwarePlatform/pytorch]] fork, but it does show up in the [[https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/pytorch/wiki/Building-PyTorch-for-ROCm][Building PyTorch
for ROCm]] wiki page:

See README.md notes on [[https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/pytorch#docker-image][Docker Image]] ... nevermind, this dockerfile receives
upstream updates, but still builds for nvidia.

*** [[https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/tensorflow][rocm/tensorflow]]

The [[https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/tensorflow-upstream/tree/develop-upstream/tensorflow/tools/ci_build][tensorflow dockerfiles]] are found in the =tools/ci_build= directory of the
[[github.com:ROCmSoftwarePlatform/tensorflow-upstream][ROCmSoftwarePlatform/tensorflow-upstream]] fork.

+ Look for recently updated dockerfiles.
+ It would seem that the main rocm/tensorflow:latest is in [[https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/tensorflow-upstream/blob/develop-upstream/tensorflow/tools/ci_build/Dockerfile.rocm][Dockerfile.rocm]]

* Data Sets

** ASL

*** [[https://huggingface.co/datasets/ncslgr][ncslgr]]

TF: [[https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/community_catalog/huggingface/ncslgr][huggingface:ncslgr/entire_dataset]]



** Language

*** [[https://universaldependencies.org][Universal Dependencies]]

TF: [[https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/universal_dependencies][tfds.datasets.universal_dependencies]]. Load with Builder:
=tfds.datasets.universal_dependencies.Builder=


* In-Memory Reps
** Pandas
v2.0.0 includes datatypes backed by Apache Arrow.

*** Topics
**** Using pyarrow
Using a pyarrow backend enables integer representations alongside nullable
data. Before v2.0.0, these would automatically convert the column to a float,
requiring more memory or more intensive CPU ops.

** Apache Arrow

** Polars

* Workflows

** Common Workflow Language

* Tools

** Google Colab

Cloud notebooks

** Data Visualization

*** Meshplot

Visualize 3D data from Jupyter with pythreejs (repo: [[https://skoch9.github.io/meshplot/tutorial/][scotch9/meshplot]])



* Optimizers
