**** IDEA (nix/guix) Private namespace for Wayland Protocol XML specs specific to application & integrations

In some galactic san francisco farfar away longlong ago, there seems to be quite
a bit of discussion regarding how/what to support.

** Topics

*** Protocol

*** Portal

*** Desktop Applications

This is already a bit complex

* Flatpak

This is a platform for distributing apps, but is technically containerized.
[[https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/tips-and-tricks.html?highlight=%22%2Fetc%2Fflatpak%22#adding-a-custom-installation][Custom installations allow you to install to flatpak-specific disk-image]]. This
can be shared to multiple VM's via proxmox to make desktop apps like
Krita/Blender/Steam more portable.

... So, if i want to distro-hop ... but I don't want to lose my app

** Caveats

When running apps from a portable flatpak custom installation, the ABIs for a
flatpak ELF must be compatible with those your system expects binaries to adhere
to.

** Issues

*** Fixing Zoom Signon in flatpak

Can be fixed in =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zoomus.conf= with
=embeddedBrowserForSSOLogin=false= according to this [[https://github.com/flathub/us.zoom.Zoom/issues/169][github issue]].

See [[https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001799006-Mass-deploying-preconfigured-settings-for-Mac][documentation of zoomus.conf]] for keys/values

*** XDG User Dirs

This requires the =xdg-user-dirs= tool

See [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_user_directories][XDG User Directories]] for more info. This file allows directories like
=$HOME/Documents= to survive reinstallation of systems & home directories in a
sane way.

#+begin_src sh :result none :eval no
dirsfile=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/user-dirs.dirs

# overwrite (requires stow .)
echo > $dirsfile
echo "XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$_DATA/xdg/Documents\"" >> $dirsfile
echo "XDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"$_DATA/xdg/Music\"" >> $dirsfile
echo "XDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$_DATA/xdg/Pictures\"" >> $dirsfile
echo "XDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$_DATA/xdg/Videos\"" >> $dirsfile
echo "XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$_DATA/xdg/Templates\"" >> $dirsfile

# and ignore these
#XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$_DATA/xdg/Desktop"
#XDG_DOWNLOADS_DIR="$_DATA/xdg/Downloads"
#XDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR="$_DATA/xdg/Public"
#+end_src

**** Note

=xdg-user-dirs-update= will replace everything if anything is invalid (only
=$HOME/yyy= or =/path/to/yyy= is valid) .it will autoupdate everything if any
dirs don't exist

*** MPD

+ beets (library management)
  - see ./Scrumplex/dotfiles/beets/.config/systemd/user/beets-mpdstats.service
+ MPRIS :: protocol to remotely control a music player (is this necessary?)
  - see ./phundrak/
+ mpd.conf :: is this necessary for the player or the clients?
+ [[https://github.com/metabrainz][metabrainz/picard]] automated tagging of music
  - github org has other projects for data analysis on music

#+begin_quote
what is MPRIS? MPD? MPV? idk.... this is kind of a huge hangup for me. i have
something of a network, but I don't use wifi (and mDNS isn't set up), so
basically no streaming works from Linux devices to your general media
players. It maybe would on WiFi, but usually requires a few extra steps

(on EVERY installation, hence why i value deterministically recreating my linux
installation!)

I can set this MPD stuff up, but every time I go to do it, I have no idea where
to get started. It doesn't seem like a priority. There are other blockers: hey,
i'll just .. use. this computer... that only has DisplayPort ... fuck.

Learning about this stuff is easy, as long as you have a mentor, Linux User
Group or group of friends who are all doing it at the same time. For whatever
reasons (mostly circumstantial), I've missed out on a lot of that.
