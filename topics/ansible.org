** Emacs

Most of the packages support =ansible~=2.9= as far as I can see.

Instead, use [[https://als.readthedocs.io/][Ansible LSP]] with [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-ansible/][lsp-ansible]]. This is a node.js app. This can be
used remotely with [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/remote/][lsp-tramp-connection]], but the remote connection has to run
Ansible LSP. This could be in Docker and I'm probably connecting to a server to
run Ansible playbooks anyways.

*** Managing dotfiles

See the =skeleton= option, which defaults to =/etc/skel=, though it's unclear
whether this is on the server or not ... it's pointless if it's on the server.

      it's probably not worth it

**** ansible.module_utils.urls

Ansible Galaxy uses [[https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/module_utils/urls.py][ansible.module_utils.urls]] to download content which is a
wrapper around Python's =urllib=.

+ You might not [[https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/module_utils/urls.py#L188-L195][HAS_CRYPTOGRAPHY]] (x509)
  - in [[https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/module_utils/urls.py#L256-L259][get_channel_binding_cert_hash]] (see RFC for [[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5929][Channel
    Bindings for TLS]]). This is skipped on OSX and when you has not crypto.
  - this is relevant when =www-authenticate= headers are set for
    Negotiate/Kerberos. It applies to GSSAPI only. No idea what this is per se
    other than kerberos is cert-based auth: see [[https://github.com/pythongssapi/httpx-gssapi][pythongssapi/HTTPX]] for the
    python implementation.
  - In other redhat contexts (see [[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/pdf/using_ansible_to_install_and_manage_identity_management/red_hat_enterprise_linux-9-using_ansible_to_install_and_manage_identity_management-en-us.pdf][Ch 20 in Giant Redhat IDM via Ansible PDF]]),
    this referes to IDM and securely delegating sudo rights via GSSAPI (The Unix
    means fo interacting with Kerberos)

+ ensure =ca_cert= is configured

***** Outline

+ create user/group, enable container services
+ determine port, dns, and firewall rules
+ create volumes
  - check space, create paths
  - chown to owner/etc
  - check for selinux issues/support
  - in the video, the volumes need =:Z= for selinux
+ setup pods
  - pull images
  - try creating with appropriate flags and see if UI supports req's
+ run galaxy-ng
  - sync to galaxy
  - define a collection(?) with a =requirements.txt=
    - all dependencies must be specified.
  - create some minimal users/groups
  - assign permissions for imports/approval
+ install the =pulp_installer= (using ansible collection)
  - to access roles, you need =pip install pulp_cli=
  - generate Galaxy-NG token, update =ansible.cfg= and include it
+ Pulp (via API after install)
  - create repo
  - create remote (ca_cert pops up)
  - create distribution, assoc to repo
+ Later
  - connect Ansible AWX to local NG
  - ensure sync is automated

* Horribly Wrongnotes

This is (AFAIK) basically completely wrong.

** Ansible is confusing

The =guix= profile will set up =ansible 2.9=, which is the last version of
ansible before the platform integrated [[https://galaxy.ansible.com][Ansible Galaxy]].

#+begin_quote
Ansible :: the device from Ender's game that communicated faster than light with zero infrastructure. It didn't require internet or subscriptions from Red Hat.
#+end_quote

This can be extremely confusing (e.g. if you used ansible once in 2014 and then again in like 2018). There is still a decent use case for =v2.9= and earlier.

*** Version 2.9: for ad hoc stuff, airgapped networks or boostrapping

These versions of ansible a set of devops tools requiring no internet access and a minimal set of dependencies

- SSH on host/target systems
- Minimal dependencies on extra pip packages (still not sure on this point)
- No external web/network services -- i.e. ansible 2.9 and earlier is like
  peer-to-peer in that any system can configure any other system without a
  need to check in to anything else.

*** Version 2.10: for more functionality, modularity or collaborative devops (with AWX)

For a firewalled environment, you'll need to set up:

+ your own Ansible Galaxy
+ probably your own docker registry
+ a small kubernetes cluster for AWX and its workers. This can fit on one small
  server
