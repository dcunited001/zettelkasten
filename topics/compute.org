** Check Versions
Use =gpu-viewer= if possible ... if it's broken, then:

+ glxinfo :: OpenGL
+ vulkaninfo :: Vulkan
+ clinfo :: OpenCL
+ es2_info :: EGL
+ vdpauinfo :: VDPAU (Supported on x11)
+ lscpu :: CPU
+ lsb_release :: Distro

** Uninstall AMDGPU Pro Drivers

These were for Blender, but weren't necessary for long...

*** Reinstall AMDGPU Open Drivers

#+begin_src shell
yay -Syu mhwd-amdgpu xf86-video-amdgpu-git \
    linux-hdr-headers-git \
    vulkan-radeon vulkan-headers vulkan-validation-layers vulkan-tools \
    mesa-git
#+end_src

But =mesa-git= conflicts with =vulkan-mesa-layers= which is provided by
=garuda-video-linux-config= ... so just install that, which supplies these:

#+begin_example
xf86-video-ati  xf86-video-amdgpu  xf86-video-nouveau  vulkan-intel  vulkan-radeon
intel-media-driver  libvdpau-va-gl  libva-intel-driver  libva-mesa-driver
mesa-vdpau  vulkan-mesa-layers  vulkan-swrast  lib32-vulkan-intel
lib32-vulkan-radeon  lib32-mesa-vdpau  lib32-libva-intel-driver
lib32-libva-mesa-driver  lib32-vulkan-mesa-layers

#Optional Deps

opencl-mesa
lib32-opencl-mesa
intel-compute-runtime
libva-vdpau-driver
lib32-libva-vdpau-driver
#+end_example

Ensure the drivers aren't blacklisted in =/etc/modprobe.d= and update
=/etc/mkinitcpio.conf=. Check kernel flags.

*** Topics

**** [[https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rbuild][RadeonOpenCompute/rbuild]]

[[https://radeonopencompute.github.io/rbuild/doc/html/gettingstarted.html][docs]]

This is a build tool referenced in several places like the MIOpen [[https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/AMDMIGraphX#use-the-rocm-build-tool-rbuild][README.md]] and
[[https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/AMDMIGraphX/blob/develop/Dockerfile][Dockerfile]], the latter of which is significantly easier to find/understand,
considering that it's 100% an AMD project (i.e. the ROCm support is considered a
first-class citizen)

Unfortunately, this is a dead end, since in all of the 94 most recently updated
ROCm repositories, there are only three =rbuild.ini= files.

**** Building using Docker images

I understand that there's a [[https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/tensorflow-build/tags][rocm/tensorflow-build]] image that would probably make
tensorflowings at least as easy to build as mediapipe. While most of the logic
generating the docker image layers is [[https://hub.docker.com/layers/rocm/tensorflow-build/2.13-python3.8-rocm5.5.0/images/sha256-7debb009365b01e0e8a588334e9db54fcc2dd727803adf9af771b9ca6a10b361?context=explore][shown on the page]] for the latest build,
the Dockerfiles are difficult to find, less so for tensorflow and more so for
Pytorch. Almost none of the key strings in these files are found in any of the
ROCmSoftwarePlatform repositories.

*** Issues

**** Use OpenCL in Docker

[[https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/issues/1180#top][RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm#1180]]: Figuring out that I need to run
=HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 python= just cost me like 12 hours bc I thought
"building native" would help me resolve issues...

**** Build Tensorflow on Archlinux

Something about XLA, a prematurely upgraded Bazel and some
=intel-oneapi-grs-fuk-agpu= prevents tensorflow from building and =clinfo= from
running on arch (as of 4/12/2023)

** Issues

*** Unknown EDID CEA parser results


Similar issues, explains what it is though.

From [[https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/daily-error-in-console-mar-2-06-30-20-truenas-kernel-drm-unknown-edid-cea-parser-results.108243/][Daily Error in Console]] (TrueNAS, March 2023):

#+begin_quote
"This is nothing. Basically, the GPU is complaining it can't establish a DRM-protected path to the monitor"
#+end_quote

From [[https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3569/~/managing-a-display-edid-on-windows][Managing display EDID on Windows]] (nvidia):

#+begin_quote
+ You can use it to fake a display being attached for testing.
+ In A/V environments with switchers and/or cable extenders the display EDID may be lost.
  - With the EDID being read from file the OS will always think the display is attached.
  - Protecting against hot plug events [or reconfiguring displays]

*** Guix
+ [[https://hpc.guix.info/blog/2024/01/hip-and-rocm-come-to-guix/][HIP and ROCm come to Guix]] AMD contributed 100+ packages to [[https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-hpc/-/tree/f976a17e5064f4f7c1cc040fee3363f28012c180/amd/packages][hpc-guix in

**** OpenCL Repositories

Unfortunately for almost any high-level dependency (signatory or tfga), you're
going to need some =dev= packages ... so these are useless for machine learning.
