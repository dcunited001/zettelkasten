*** Unknown EDID CEA parser results

Similar issues, explains what it is though.

"This is nothing. Basically, the GPU is complaining it can't establish a DRM-protected path to the monitor"

From [[https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3569/~/managing-a-display-edid-on-windows][Managing display EDID on Windows]] (nvidia):

#+begin_quote
+ You can use it to fake a display being attached for testing.
+ In A/V environments with switchers and/or cable extenders the display EDID may be lost.
  - With the EDID being read from file the OS will always think the display is attached.
  - Protecting against hot plug events [or reconfiguring displays]
