*** Intrusion Detection

If socat can run, then it should be possible to use it (and maybe light
iptables) to intercept traffic streams, duplex them and forward them to an
off-device instance of snort or something

... this is without something like an $500 ARM device or the $100 [[https://shop.hak5.org/products/throwing-star-lan-tap][Hak5 ethernet
ninja star]] thing that only people with annual average salaries above that of
Saharan Africa can afford.

Ahhhh it really pays to be poor. It's about the journey, not the destination! It
really ~just~ forces you to develop smart ways /just/ to get around -- which is
obviously something most people appreciate! That's why people like Marc Cuban
value keeping their kids poor of course. So they have a well-balanced
perspective and a background with challenges to overcome.

*** Filesystem


**** /tmp (ramfs)


**** /jffs (jffs2)

*** SSH

This requires RSA-2048 which has bit me so many times

*** [[https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Ipkg][ipkg]]

A package manager that can get =socat= on the device somehow...
