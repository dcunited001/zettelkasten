** Topics

*** Usability

+ =do show ...= from within config modes
+ =show run | beg $KEYPHRASE= is very helpful
+ Use the linux vtty's and serial.
  - SSH and IP config aren't needed this way. No lost connections.
  - i.e. you're better off on a server without a GUI
+ run =set BAUD 115200= in ROMMON for faster connection.
  - commands output much more quickly.
  - 9600 is 1200 bytes per second...

*** Configuring SSH


**** From old notes

*Caveat Lector:* This section contains an incomplete description of the process,
but it includes some some useful tricks using GNU screen if you're on a serial
connection.

Particularly, some of the older hardware uses older algorithms, but also
certificate formats that are non-standard (or at least unusual), which makes it
a bit wierd to import. I can't remember which method I got to work: either
transferring files via =xmodem= or transferring text.

***** TODO Describe problems with =crypto key rsa import=

Yeh, som of this is reaaly really bad.

***** Importing External Keys

=crypto key rsa import $KEYNAME pem url xmodem:/file= was working for
either public or private keys (when one was in PEM format).

This approach wasnt working for me -- SSH user setup just needs
=key-string= anyways.

***** Generating Keypairs

- Run =crypto key rsa generate rsa modulus 4096= to generate a generic
  keypair. This requires a hostname & domain name.
- Validate generation/upload with =do show crypto key mypubkey all=
- Remove keys with =crypto key rsa zeroize $KEYNAME=

***** Setup SSH

This will let you remotely manage your router (and use tools like
ansible)

+ Configuring SSH from Linux
  - IOS doesn't accept DSA or OpenSSH keys
  - keys need to be in the format of =ssh-rsa ... comment=
+ Refer to this post on [[https://nsrc.org/workshops/2016/renu-nsrc-cns/raw-attachment/wiki/Agenda/Using-SSH-public-key-authentication-with-Cisco.html][Cisco/SSH via Linux]]

****** Generate keys

Older cisco devices want RSA, but generating 4096b keys on the device
takes forever.

+ Run =ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f $FILENAME=
+ Use screen & =exec !! fold= to copy/paste into the key-string
  - or modify the key-string in a config that you upload
+ Verify the key with =ssh-keygen -E md5 -lf $FILENAME.pub=

***** Configuring SCP Transfers

****** TODO maybe figure this out someday. maybe not.

*** Linux Tools for Cisco

**** TFTP: =dnsmasq=

Ensure your firewall is temporarily configured. Only TFTP downloads
are allowed.

=dnsmasq --no-daemon --enable-tftp --tftp-root=$TFTPROOT -i $IFACE=

**** Serial: =screen=

***** Enable Linux Serial for User

Find the =/dev/ttySn= serial file. Also, add user to =dialout= group.

For faster connection, run =set BAUD 115200= or the serial gnomes won't favor
your file transfers.

***** Use Screen to Transfer Files to IOS via Serial

To transfer files like IOS updates, type =C-a := in screen. Then run =exec !! sx
-b -X $FILENAME= to copy.

The =-b= flag pipes binary data into screen, so the IOS terminal can be expected
to receive it. From what I remember, this is tricky to time right.

At the correct time, press the button after typing:

=copy xmodem:/flash:/filename.bin=

Press it again if it didn't work. Also, this must be done from within ROMMON,
unless the =copy= menu gives you access to =xmodem:=

***** Pasting A Big SSH Key

To emulate copy/paste in screen, enter content into a file, then type =C-a := in
screen to run Screen commands.

Run =exec !! fold -bw72 $FILENAME= and the content will be piped in as input.

Cisco has a maximum of 254 chars per line, so the =-bw72= arg specifies a
maximum.

***** Updating IOS from ROMMON

** Hardware

*** 2960



* Avaya

** Issues

*** Ctrl-y

Avaya expects a "Ctrl-y" after boot. This is displayed to a user
connecting to a console (with putty/etc) ... if the console cable is
connected during the boot.

* DDWRT

** Topics

*** Basic Install/Config

Some generic steps to walk through in the webui

**** Install
+ Reset Netgear Router
+ Walk through initial Netgear setup (one last time)
+ Then flash the *.chk file to the router

**** Initial Config
+ Set a new admin/password
+ Disable wifi radios
+ Set time zone
+ Configure Gateway
  - network/cidr/gateway
+ Configure LAN
  - network/cidr/gateway (and a router IP address)
+ Configure DHCP
+ Configure NTP
  - most external router should sync to =time.nist.gov=
+ Configure Administration settings
  - change protocol to HTTPS
  - disable info site
  - restrict  remote ip range

*** Intrusion Detection

If socat can run, then it should be possible to use it (and maybe light
iptables) to intercept traffic streams, duplex them and forward them to an
off-device instance of snort or something

#+begin_quote
... this is without something like an $500 ARM device or the $100 [[https://shop.hak5.org/products/throwing-star-lan-tap][Hak5 ethernet
ninja star]] thing that only people with annual average salaries above that of
Saharan Africa can afford.

Ahhhh it really pays to be poor. It's about the journey, not the destination! It
really ~just~ forces you to develop smart ways /just/ to get around -- which is
obviously something most people appreciate! That's why people like Marc Cuban
value keeping their kids poor of course. So they have a well-balanced
perspective and a background with challenges to overcome.

*** Filesystem


**** /tmp (ramfs)


**** /jffs (jffs2)

+ [[https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Jffs][Journaling Flash File System]]


*** SSH

This requires RSA-2048 which has bit me so many times

*** [[https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Ipkg][ipkg]]

A package manager that can get =socat= on the device somehow...



** Issues

*** ipkg commands report missing files or read-only file system

+ [[https://forum.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=503846][old post]] seems to indicate missing modules or potential storage issues
