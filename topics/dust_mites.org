Normally this affects more than one person in the household ... but I'm
constantly isolated, so I have nothing to go on (and neither does anyone else).

+ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/scabies/comments/nqf67j/black_fibers_in_the_nodules/][Black Fibers in the Nodules]] person gets morgellons (associated with
  [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?linkname=pubmed_pubmed_citedin&from_uid=27789971][Lyme/borrelia]]) from a um scabies infection

*** Crusted Scabies
+ [[https://www.dermatologyadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/dermatology/crusted-exaggerated-norwegian-scabies/][Norwegian Crusted Scabies]] The discoloration of skin is easier to see here. I
  have a similar effect on the inside of my ears (slight darkening, slightly
  olive coloration). The skin toughens while it's progressing until it's
  distinctively harder. Picking at it pulls on the local region of skin and it
  peels off, pulling into deeper layers of skin (I didn't do it twice...)

+ r/scabies user goes through 2 rounds permethrin and 1 round ivermectin. (link
  removed bc um do not search dermatological shit, generally)
  - Her ear looks identical to the pictures i took from a year ago. I went to
    the doctor about 2.5 weeks ago: both ears started bleeding at the same time.
    This was a result of the sudden "toughening of skin", but I wasn't sure (it
    seemed to be symmetric).

**** Microscopy

After seeing these images, I'm 100% sure that's what I'm seeing at 60-120x
magnification. It took forever.

+ "Follicles" of about 5-15μm. If they could be stretched, they may be up to
  1mm. They are completely invisible 99% of the time. Human hair appears to be
  able +5x larger in diameter.
+ Egg sacs of somewhere b/w 15-30μm with egg-like dots of less than 5μm.

i'm using a handheld $15 microscope & only occasionally grabbing with tape or
attempting to create slides. With these tools, the actual mites are basically
impossible to see. They are more frequent with orangeish skin (eww... if you
know). The mites are maybe 30-50μm, but just appear as vague orangish dots where
the only characteristic features are mostly:

+ a vague general shape distinct from white skin flakes
+ an iron-colored center: red/brown (blood or the characteristic color of
  insect-digested blood)
+ and the ferrous dispersion of orangey tones surrounding the nucleus

I probably look insane with the microscope ... but it's seriously just poverty.
I've seriously wanted a proper microscope (esp. digital & compatible with
USB/iPhone) for about 7-8 years bc it.

The permethrin is probably effective, but my garage & workshop are infested. I
got "bit" again and this usually happens at its worst in those two areas (where
it gets inflamed within 30-90 minutes). Supposedly, they burrow, then inflame.
That is _not_ what is happening some 2-10% of the time. I'm being reexposed in
those areas...

This reached it's absolute maximum _exactly when I got a therapy ultimatum_. The
likelihood that I would be misdiagnosed with delusional parasitosis is high --
and if hospitalized "it would magically disappear!" WOW! I mean, do you realized
how fucking angry I am? Even if it is just bad luck?! This is absolutely
functionally coupled to disrupting kind of a lot in my life, regardless of
whether it's some accidental blight from God.

It's not that bad and they should all be dead, but what concerns me is that
(again) there's nothing I can really do about it, but type in my notes generally
at the internet. All my mom has said for the past year is "turn the lights out"
like it's supposed to mean something else? idk.

*** Misc
+ I've taken the permethrin -- as much as I didn't want to, considering I've had
  a bad response to deltamethrin sprayed in my garage/woodworking area -- so I
  shouldn't be contagious. And actually, you should exhibit an increased rate of
  dermatological effects while the permethrin is acting to alleviate an
  infection.

** Notes

*** 2025/9/9

#+begin_quote
One of my right occipital lymph nodes is swollen. Probably the one
draining the other occipital nodes from higher in the scalp.

+ This rash & also the same swollen lymph node (possibly on the opposite side)
  also happened a year ago around the same time. It happened late in the
  infection cycle & subsided quickly. It was enough to get me to screenshot
  pictures in my anatomy app.
+ Both sides of the scalp have recurrent eruptions of what looks like atopic
  dermititus: it's dry-ish and tends to flake if lightly scratched.
+ Not correlated with follicle processes AFAIK.
+ Possibly fungal idk, but most fungal scalp infections seem to "utilize" the
  hair (maybe for hair's moisture retention, pictures imply the fungal structure
  proceeds from the skin & follical roots into the hair). Ringworm is different.
  - One common theme here: otherwise benign/transient infections are becoming
    common/persistent -- e.g. tooth decay at back of mouth from slightly drooping
    gums, indicating persistent gingivitus of some kind or another (or possibly
    disrupted mouth pH/balance from zyn idk). But these are all unrelated and
    the combination presents as idiopathic (the symptoms I report to the doctors
    don't match a recognized "fact pattern" and it's hard to determine what's
    germaine/causative)
  - There's also a persistent fungal infection on the top of my left foot which
    itches from time to time. It was less prominent the athletes foot that
    resulted in permenaent keracytosis of the soles of my feet. It doesn't seem
    to be related to the athletes foot.
  - The fungal infection on the top of my feet is concerning: because nothing
    has affected it for about 18 months.
    - It doesn't really have an appearance, per se, except a slight redness, so
      it's hard to say. It resembles(?) pictures of candida aureus, the
      anti-fungal resistent variant. That starts as a small red spot (if on the
      skin...) and once colonized can spread into deeper tissue. From there,
      that variant is deadly like +20% of the time.
    - That fungus is devious because it's resistance against anti-fungals is
      "dumb" -- it simply overexpresses proteins with beta-glucans in a pattern
      that keeps it at arms-length from most anti-fungals. This also keeps it at
      arms-length from the immune system: the resistence is one and the same.
      It's like micro-keratocytosis, but not necessarily involving dermal
      processes. The immune system can't necessarily tell if it's cleared the
      infection, so the fungus goes dormant.
+ NOTHING itches -- except occasionally during the "biting" ... which if
  scabies, is not actually biting. That feels like the pins & needles of mild
  neuropathy, but like 1/1000 to 1/100 the number of pins. That has passed. When
  it happens there's usually a small nearby "bite mark" that appears about 6-36
  hours later.
  - this itching/rash could really be 1,000,000 different things: uraemic
    pruritus with small very early calciphylaxis (but definitely unlikely to be
    the latter)
  - the distribution of the rash is the same location where diabetics have
    uraemic pruritis on the scalp, but idk enough about the pathology or
    progression
  - if so, then, it would be idiopathic: I'm not diabetic. my eGFR was ~80-85
    two years ago: slightly below normal and above the 60 cutoff... unlikely

Lymph nodes swell and subside all the time. Usually there is a cause, but idk.

+ Localized lymph drainage indicates high flux through nearby tissue being
  funneled into the lymph network, mostly interstitial fluid.
+ It moves slowly (motion is generated oncotic pressures and also by _random
  forces_ contributing to hydrodynamic pressures: [[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4267889/][Mechanical Forces & Lymph
  Transport]]). Body positions that create local pressures or create an
  orthostatic effect alter the flow of lymph (i.e. yoga), whether the specific
  effects are intentional or even significant.
+ It's potentially dangerous if it creates conditions that trap
  toxins/waste for too long:
  - transient obstruction of lymph flow could amplify an existing immunopathology or
    exacerbate underlying causes of cancer/toxicity above a threshold.
  - Certainly, there should be pain when it's at an extreme (or at least
    discomfort & awareness of tissue deformation)

** Possibilities...
*** Sarcoptes Scabiei: The Mange

Great. [[https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/mites-that-bug-people#section_heading_10922][Scabies]]...

God, now I feel kinda horrible for all those [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gspElv1yvc&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD][McLachlan puppies]]: they /get/ the
mange from the abusive household and run away to avoid it, but can't clear the
infection bc of their fur. Life is much less depressing when explained in
detail, isn't it?

*** Itch Mites

[[https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/mites-that-bug-people#section_heading_10924][Itch Mites]]: Well it sounds better than "the literal fucking mange."

*** Ceratopogonidae

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratopogonidae][Ceratopogonidae]] Not a mite, but I have found a few of these species, though I
had never seen them in Virginia (or anywhere).

From 8/17/2024, found in my adderall bottle.

[[file:img/noseeums/ceratopogonidae_9701.jpg]]

From 7/22/2025, dangling on an impossibly singular spider web.

[[file:img/noseeums/ceratopogonidae_2213.jpg]]

These aren't the problem though. Just noise. The 2024 infestation occured while
I dealt with multiple brown recluse bites... though small, somewhat necrotic.
Amid an infestation of "False Widows", which are always a joy to find ... until
you carelessly bumble into a real one.

* Overview

I magically got some kind of mite infestation last year that fed a spider
infestation in my workshop. I cleared the spiders out and the mites eventually
went away.

+ These seem to numb the skin. The scalp itches frequently. They are definitely
  in my bed now. That didn't happen last year.
+ You notice crawling, then numbness & occasionally a reddening of the skin no
  larger than ~2-3mm radius
+ A day or so later, one small circular bite, but occasionally small clusters
  over a 25mm radius
+ I have a 30-60x loupe and a 60-120x LED magnifier. They're difficult to use,
  but I have seen almost nothing.

I just saw what looks like a 25µm black thing on my finger, which may be
mite-poop. I've seen this several times and it's the only typical visual sign
that's "consistent"... in quotes because it's almost entirely nondescript: no
features; nothing "animate". And certainly _not_ visible to the naked eye.

#+begin_quote
NO ONE AND I MEAN NOT A SINGLE FUCKING PERSON EVER EVEN SO MUCH AS USES MY
FUCKING BATHROOM. There is not a single person that would understand what I go
through. If I talk to the doctor therapist about things like this, I'll be
accused of "having the meth bugs" or goddammit i have no fucking clue. The
original infestation occured PRECISELY at a "therapy ultimatum" by the way. I
HATE insecticides and I do NOT want to be living around neurotoxins.

There's not a single person that can help me translate experiences like this,
suggest possibilities or advise me on what to do. When I ask for help (FOR
ANYTHING), it ALWAYS provokes arguments where ANYTHING I say is steered towards
causing /MAXIMAL disruption/ in the discussion -- and at the end, I AM ALWAYS
REMINDED OF HOW I WILL BE HOMELESS /AS SOON AS/ MY MOTHER DIES ... My brother
tells me this like he's talking to a retarded three year old that needs special
handling because they clearly do not understand the consequences of their
decisions or whatever.

I've narrowed it down to dust mites. These mites seem foreign. I've never heard
of anything like this. I surmised that, they are parasites, which will go
dorment without a host and that I'd maybe encounter them again the next year.

... I was correct. Again, I'm pretty sure these are NOT native to the area.
Before the infestation, I had heard some people talking about "no-see-ums" and
midge flies immediately before I noticed this last year... same progression, a
lot of similar details... but particularly described as "burrowing into the
skin, etc, etc" which is not at all what those are. I guess that's just a non
sequitor though. (***)

For the only possible family [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratopogonidae][Ceratopogonidae]] -- of which two I had found with
one /directly/ in my adderall bottle; and also completely novel in this area --
anyways, at all stages of the life cycle, they are too large. The larve are
always described as being 750-1500µm.

Fucking stupid ass bullshit drains a significant amount of my time/energy... and
there's never a single person to be like "man, what the fuck is biting me?" ...
which would go a long way towards fixing something.

I've been the subject of neglect/abuse and the more I make my case, the more
strongly I get repressed and alienated...


#+begin_quote
(***) The thing about "white noise torture" and extreme social isolation: you
tend to conflate the only "signal" you ever experience for being meaningful.
Change the city I live in? Change my life. Simple as that. This is a small town
with basically zero technology community. I am supposed to give up everything
I've ever struggled for to work at Burger King. Fuck that.

And I've tried to "help improve things" but no one pulls me into anything,
really. There are zero strong social connections and it's been that way for
years. Any new acquaitances are easily programmed with what can only be
described as an accidential computer virus that perpetuates bullshit labels I
have no control over. I notice strong changes in how people frame their
interactions with me (or so I think) in the second/third time meeting me. It
never recovers. No one reaches out to me, I have an attachment disorder and I
make less than $3000/per year. These dynamics make it IMPOSSIBLE to re-normalize
my social life.

If you don't understand that, then /there's something wrong with how you model
social patterns/. Mainly, you have it on "easy mode" and the bottom has never
fallen out of your social life. There are an unbelievable number of things that
are just "not going horribly wrong" in your life that you can lose. You wouldn't
even know what they are -- and not only will you never have to care but you'll
never be able to help someone like me.

If it was psychological or psychiatric, therapy would help or maybe
medication... When it's almost purely social, neither will do anything. The
latter will destroy my mind. And coaching me to "lower my goals" is bullshit
when there is literal neglect/abuse. You have no idea how cold it is to mindfuck
someone into accepting that. If you change my social circumstances, you change
my life. I have neither the money nor the social access to this sociophysical
black hole -- and if you didn't fully parse the metaphor _there is a literal
event horizon_.
