  - Exactly what I'm looking for, except printable.
  - It should be fairly trivial to get [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][noctoid/general.el]] to output the last
    =X-*= modifier-key pair, for a mode/context.
  - From here, ShortcutMapper's python lib can interpret the bindings and
    generate the keyboard description metadata.

*** TODO produce freedesktop/xkbprint pdf's for emacs mode
+ go from list of bindings/modes in a context (along with configuration for how
  to split up modkeys in final render)
  - to org with tables (chance to customize what's displayed)
  - to largeformat xkbprint output
  - to PDF via ps2pdf
+ if it's big enough to display keycodes, it's large enough to print, especially
  if you interleave pages sent to =ps2pdf= with pages that further describe
  keycodes
+ however, getting emacs and org-exports latex to produce tables is simple
  enough for now

#+begin_example text

I've never actually worked alongside someone who uses the cool "half & half" two
handed keyboards. Maybe in passing. I AM ISOLATED ... do I sound repititive? I
can explain how I end up in the extreme margins of 5,000 distributions.

I spent quite a lot of time customizing my macbook keyboards but somehow had no
idea that you can buy a keyboard that allows loading custom firmware.

I was able to engage/connect with like-minded people at VWCC about technology, including
keyboards/etc. but the DEA manipulated the supply of Amphetamine precursors. I
can deal without having Adderal, but I can't deal with 2-3 hours of phone calls
and pharmacy/doctor drop-ins ... on and off for days _and_ weeks.

Those might just be the FAFSA funds I would receive, if I didn't drop out.

** 3D Printable
+ (Riskable) [[https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/these-open-source-levitating-keyboard-switches-can-be-3d-printed-at-home-202645/][These open-source, levitating keyboard switches can be 3D printed at home]]
  - requires a hall-effect sensor per key. this could be expensive.
** Keycap Design Types/Ideas

Why springs/buttons? Or the butterfly switch thingies with the conductive
traces?

What else could be used?

*** Compliant Mechanism

This won't hold up to the mechanical forces, but it's the first thing that
popped into my head.

*** Ferrofluid-based pressure sensor
By itself, it's terrible for a keyboard. it would feel very wierd and your
keyboard might leak toxic chemicals. But with the right tweaks ... who knows?
If designed with the proper materials, a fluid-based mechanism would hold up to
mechanical wear.
