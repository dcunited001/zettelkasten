  - convert windows layout to xkb symbols using python
+ [[https://github.com/xkbmon/xkbmon][xkbmon/xkbmon]] display keyboard layout in taskbar (dwm, i3, tmux, etc)
+ [[https://github.com/divvun/kbdgen][divvun/kbdgen]] (rust) generate keyboards for many platforms from one spec
  - example project: [[github:giellalt/keyboard-sme][giellalt/keyboard-sme]]
+ [[github:divvun/xkb-parser][divvun/xkb-parser]] (rust) XKB format parser
  - and it parses the geometry files ... well kinda (FIXME)

** Docs
+ [[github:freedesktop/xkbprint][freedesktop/xkbprint]]: print a keyboard layout

*** TODO produce freedesktop/xkbprint pdf's for emacs mode
+ go from list of bindings/modes in a context (along with configuration for how
  to split up modkeys in final render)
  - to org with tables (chance to customize what's displayed)
  - to largeformat xkbprint output
  - to PDF via ps2pdf
+ if it's big enough to display keycodes, it's large enough to print, especially
  if you interleave pages sent to =ps2pdf= with pages that further describe
  keycodes
+ however, getting emacs and org-exports latex to produce tables is simple
  enough for now
