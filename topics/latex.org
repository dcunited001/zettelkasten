*** Templates

**** [[https://github.com/jankapunkt/latexcv][jankapunkt/latexcv]]

A collection of CV, Resume, and Infographic LaTeX templates. The infographics
are especially useful.

**** Overleaf: [[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/simple-hipster-cv/cnpkkjdkyhhw][Hipster CV]]

+ Repo: [[https://github.com/latex-ninja/hipster-cv][latex-ninja/hipster-cv]]
+ Fairly good use of space, not much room for detail
+ The packages are hidden in =hipstercv.cls= and =hipstercv.sty=

**** Overleaf: [[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/altacv-template/trgqjpwnmtgv][AltaCV]]

+ Repo: [[https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV][liantze/AltaCV]]
+ Good use of space/typography
+ Two Column


**** Overleaf: Others
+ [[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/autocvmkr-cv-template/qqgywjpfdjwj][autoCVmkr]] Decent use of space, some examples to extract
+ [[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/printable-spider-cv/mqqnfrgdhnmp][Spider CV]]: interesting overall design. probably a little too kische to copy.


*** Misc Notes

**** Do All CV's Go On A4 Paper?

I'm thinking about writing my resume on that European size paper, you know the
one that's almost 8.5x11, but isn't? A4 that's what it is: the paper they sell
for artists that's irritatingly close to the US Letter size but won't properly
fit into any other notebook.

Almost no one will print one out anyways, unless they're going through a stack,
in which case it's probably a tech lead or department hiring manager. It could
be an HR person. However, if you printed out and thought I did it wrong, I
probably don't want to work for you anyways... ok I'm not actually going to do
this.

You'd be surprised how many Americans probably don't know how to dial an
international number or speak another language besides English ... but I bet
Europeans get sent resumes that can't print on A4 all the time.

Oh that's right, re-phrase it in a cultural frame and now I can't sound like an
asshole. Some Americans are insular and so typically offended when presented
with things outside their world.

And apparently the answer is yes ... Europeans and most of the world put their
Resume's on [[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jan-kusters-two-column-cv/mgdkqgdcktjv][A4 paper]]:

* Tools

** Packages
+ geometry

** Emacs

*** CDLatex

Templating

** TeX

According to overleaf, there are three main TeX engines: pdftex, xetex and
luatex.

*** pdfTeX

*** xeTeX

*** luaTeX

** TikZ
+ [[https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/LaTeX_Graphics_using_TikZ%3A_A_Tutorial_for_Beginners_(Part_4)%E2%80%94Circuit_Diagrams_Using_Circuitikz][LaTeX Graphics using TikZ (4): Circuit Diagrams Using Circuitikz]]

* Issues
** Org Babel
*** [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-LaTeX.html#fn.6][Mixing Org Babel results into exported latex fragments]]
- the texlive =numprint= package can format results returned from blocks.
  - python floats will need to be printed/returned as strings.
  - with named blocks or =#+CALL:=, using =:results output= or =:results value=
    in the wrong situations may require a few extra blocks
    - to format/parse strings
    - to combine results or name a result (to use in a =<<noweb_template()>>=)
*** [[https://orgmode.org/worg/library-of-babel.html][A collection of useful Library of Babel functions]]
- reading/writing files for input to babel blocks

** Indentation
Use =\noindent= to remove indentation and =\usepackage{indentfirst}= to indent
paragraphs that follow section headers.
