** Silverblue
** IoT
Basically silverblue without a window manager (intended for lightweight devices)
** Issues
*** registry.fedoraproject.org is DNS-proxied and behind cloudfront
The DNS-proxy doesn't seem to matter (name resolves to the same ip), but without
a mirror, I'm not sure how to deal with cloudfront.net.
