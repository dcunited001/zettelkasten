It's probably bad RAM, but it's cost me an unbelievable amount of time. It
doesn't display the error unless you're in a terminal.

*** SMART Status

**** Where is the SMS (Sudden Motion Sensor)?

[[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201666][Mac notebooks: About the Sudden Motion Sensor]]

- SMS events are logged in smartctl as "Free Fall", which shows more than 4,000
  events ... I've dropped this laptop like twice.

**** High Load_Cycle_Count (857372)

[[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/504245/s-m-a-r-t-shows-high-load-cycle-count-why-and-how-to-prevent-the-number-from][S/O post]] answers that this is results from a technique Western Digital (and
other manufacturers use).

*** Testing RAM
Ram tests fine

* Macbook Pro Late 2013 (fully loaded)

Screen is broken. Go figure. The keyboard bounced -- long time ago... lesson
learned. Anyways . . . It's usable & worth salvaging, but the display damage is
refractory: gets worse, doesn't get better.

Options:

+ use as server ... but literally anything touching this makes the display
  worse, though it's boot menus are operable without it.
  - however, the unibody frame is necessary for cooling to work
+ use as scrap, buy a nearly identical MBP, same year/model -- but without the
  massive surcharge that someone would add for a fully loaded (which mine was)
  - move the logic board to the new body and just use as is.

** AHCI SSD
So I have a 500GB SSD which is difficult to integrate into any system. (details

** Issues

*** Linux GPU support sucks

- arch briefly had the 4xx nVidia drivers ...
