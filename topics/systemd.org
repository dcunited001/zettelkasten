*** List Subcommands

See

**** Via Man
What are the systemd subcommands? =man systemctl= doesn't show much (i forgot
there are =systemd.$subcmd= commands)

#+begin_src sh :results output verbatim
# I couldn't retain the descriptions bc the regexp seemed to lead me towards
# weird matching groups.
man -k 'systemd' --sections=1 \
    | grep -e '^systemd' \
    | sed -E 's/\(.*//' \
    | sed -e 's/-/\//g' \
    | tree --fromfile .

# (the hierarchical organization here doesn't make sense ... )
#+end_src

I honestly just need to see whatever it is that my completion is seeing. There's
a ton of features that help with the CLI -- the ones I'm looking for are mostly
_interactive_ features, so they're not going to show up in any scripts that I can
grep.
