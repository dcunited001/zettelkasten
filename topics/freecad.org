+ generated docs are online (API docs, 600MB), but this is the =WebDoc= make task
  - the complete DevDocs include graphs and are ~3GB
  - See [[https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_DependencyGraph][Source Documentation]] for instructions on generating
+ doxygen can generate graphs similar to FreeCAD [[https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_DependencyGraph][Std_DependencyGraph]]

This appears to work

# it could be -j16, which is exactly why i wanted this cpu. and you can NOT
# build software on windows w/o visual studio. it's a fool's errand, though it's
# probably not as tough as getting open source working on native windows
make -j12 DevDoc

# wait

** Doxygen Links
+ [[file:/data/ecto/FreeCAD/freecadbuild/doc/SourceDocu/html/d9/dad/classSketcher_1_1SketchObject.html][Sketcher::SketchObject]] large collaboration diagram; includes most GUI pieces
  - [[diagram; touches most][App::Document]] mostly overlaps, but with reduced complexity
+ Inheritance Diagram for [[diagram; touches most][Part::Feature]] is hilariously ... byzantine

  - the project files are zipped. set up "filter attributes" in git to use
    zippey to provide proper diffs.
