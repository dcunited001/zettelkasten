** $CO_2$ Saturation

*** ELI5

Is carbon a greenhouse gas? This [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeYfl45X1wo][Earth: Climate Wars]] video is actually supports
the $CO_2$ saturation arguments.

Apparently this was recorded on a camera with 1 to 5µm spectrum, but you can see
that the flame disappears, does it not? Why doesn't the camera record anything
lower than zero? Because it's impossible.

In the same way, $CO_2$ will absorb all the energy it can until there is zero,
at which point it can't possibly absorb any more and neither can any other
chemical regardless of its GWP units.

Okay, is this overly simplistic? My bad. I'm so sorry about that. That would be
disingenuous and downright intellectually dishonest. You have to account for
collisions between molecules, but that just comes out as dispersion of thermal
radiation into other spectral bands. Thermal radiation corresponds to
/stochastic movement/ of molecules and atoms, when photons in a specific
spectrum are interacting with matter, it can only absorb them according to how
the wavelength influences the matter (primarily electrons).

Assuming a globally consistent concentration at some height $f(h)$ then,
increasing the $CO_2$ total concentration from $0 \leq h$ lowers $h_{max}$, the
level at which $CO_2$ stops absorbing energy. It isn't the only molecule
carrying energy. Specific heat capacity is a bit more important and this is
/generally relative/ to the mass. More mass? More dense? More total heat
capacity and more a collision's kinetic response will convert into thermal
velocity.

Increasing carbon concentrations at lower atmospheric levels will have different
effects depending on the thermal absorption/emission spectrum of lower and
higher heights of the atmosphere. Whether the specific interactions between
matter cause heat to propagates up or propagates down determines whether there
is heat loss. If matter absorbs thermal energy it will diffuse. How a gas
interacts with the pressure/temperature at different heights will change how it
diffuses and trasfers energy. Some gases will carry more energy with them and
others will absorb energy from alternate bands of the spectrum while taking a
diffusion path that carries it back down.

It's disingenuous to say that the "spectral saturation" "theory" has been
debunked. It's fruitless to have a conversation with someone who says that and
is unwilling to entertain more complicated models. I'm willing to listen and to
be wrong. It sounds like the other side of this debate isn't. They rely on
overly simplistic models they claim are justified "because the average person
might misunderstand."

Where's the policy action? Carbon. Where's the remaining spectral bands of the
atmospheric window? about 5 to 10 µm wavelength. Everything else is saturated,
but the height at which those bands saturate is unclear. The greatest potential
for additonal energy capture is not on anyone's radar because the
academic/political elite are so sure that the population couldn't possible
understand. It would be dangerous to allow them to think about it, so propaganda
it is.

We are literally at the point where celebrities don't use their private jets out
of shame. It's dangerously irrational without more objective information.

**** On The Positivity of Energy

Energy is /always/ a positive value unless accompanied by a potential energy
reference. Generally it's meaningless without such a reference somewhere: this
is similar to choosing a reference frame. Absolute zero is the universal
reference frame when energy is converted to temperature. If I'm mincing
terminology, then why are there no negative values on these spectrum charts?

It isn't easy to systematize this completely, since some unit conversions are
the result of deconstructing integrals (rearranging the terms).

[[file:img/si-units.svg]]

A useful exercise is graph traversals on the SI unit correspondence chart --
e.g. trying to relate the units from $U_1 = [m, \frac{m}{s}, \frac{m}{s^2}]$
with $U_2 = [kg, kg \cdot s, kg \cdot \frac{s}{s}]$. When you do the dot-product
or outer product, what units emerge? How do they relate? When you encounter
these in equations, what options do you have for theorums to apply? I haven't
thought the outer-product through, but for each entry in the dot-product $U_1
\cdot U_2$, where could you hide an integral? What law does that correspond to.

And finally, what does it all mean, when you go from one set of units to
another? Can you take a sequence of unit transformations and map it to a graph
traversal? Or when you change both sides of an equation? Why is it important to
write units into your equations? How does this help you understand the theorems
generally?

Here are potential paths through the graph:

*** Why it's important

Given that any inaccuracy or local variation in $CO_2$'s spectral saturation
represents a large potential shift in absorbed heat, it's important to be sure.
However, it seems that scientists are just afraid to speak out. Given that the
mass, total content and total area under the earth's thermal emission spectrum
are all far higher for water than for $CO_2$, maybe we should ban
that. Regardless, any reasonable policy or advice should compare their
assumptions/recommendations to water as a litmus for ridiculousness.

We absolutely need to conduct costs/benefits analysis here. If this is urgent,
then there are opportunity costs in chasing $CO_2$. I would assume that $CO_2$
in the ocean would melt glaciers faster, but where's the visibility on that
issue? Where's the desalinization technology that gives us an interface to "boil
the oceans" and extract pollutants/acidity?

No one is even talking about realistic implementations technologies -- instead
most business endeavors here are just greenwashing. "We'll send the carbon to
the bottom of the ocean" and things like this sound an awful lot like
Scientology trying to cleanse the thetans when $CO_2$ is saturated. And if it
is, this means that _ALL_ your efforts in carbon policy are /wasted/ because
they produce diminishing returns with exponential costs. We could have focused
on real targets for global warming, but no one knows wtf is going on because GWP
is measured relative to $CO_2$.

** GWP Global Warming Potential

Any of [[file:img/refrigerant_table_June2019.pdf][these Refrigerants]] have a more serious GWP than $CO_2$, considering that
$CO_2$ effect is oversaturated at 1km. Their spectrum is not relative to the
$CO_2$ absorption spectrum whatsoever, which is why GWP is not grounded in
meaning! I'm sorry, but you need to expect that people understand how to combine
SI Units.

You must develop more accurate units even if the antifa or econut protestors
can't grok the science. That's too bad. If they cared so much, they would _read
a book_. If they were more concerned about objectivity rather than
sensationalism on social media as a hack, then maybe we could get something
done. The reason I'm angry is because the left fucks everything up and we cannot
entrust this issue to you if you're just going to fuck it up like everything
else. I don't see the conservatives taking a strong stand on this and if you use
weak measures while hiding behind censorship & cheap tricks, who's going to save
us? Yeh, not the left. You're only weakening the issue here, which makes you
inevitably vulnerable. Do I really need to remind the left how badly the fucked
up their coronavirus response? Take the capes off until you're ready to be
heroes instead of simply play-acting.

GWP in proportion to CO2 units is basically meaningless. Any singular system of
units is here challenging to develop. The primary units should be relative to
the total area under the curve for theoretical thermal emission. A secondary
system of units should be used to determine how much the chemical would create a
change in this emission spectrum -- this is difficult to empirically verify, but
even worse is that it changes, so unless you're creative, your units would
change.  Other systems of units should be devised, but it's impossible to
determine the actual effect a chemical would have without taking into account
the atmospheric dispersion of a chemical.

You should be so lucky to encounter scalar units. You need a set of standards
for visualization of the spectrum that's easy to read/interpret that forms the
basis for conversations based in fact. Such a system must not lend itself to
confusion. These graphs should convey individual contribution to the earth's
emission spectrum alongside the total saturation.

It's just unbelievable to finally really dig into the science here and realize
just how problematic the semantics are. The truth is that any time you're
dealing with simple units (particularly scalar values), you're probably in high
school and God I hope you're not in graduate school.

If people cannot understand anything other than simple scalar GWP, then I guess
we need to invest in education. Can we trust the left to not fuck that up?

*** GWP and Refrigerants

I would be far more concerned about health and environmental effects from
exposure events than about GWP when selecting refrigerants, esp. given that
cycling out equipment requires retooling industrial production and large costs
borne mostly by building owners.

It would make more sense to prioritize thermally sealed homes & buildings,
though that's somewhat decoupled from refrigerant selection and HVAC. However,
given that malfunction occurs during HVAC system stress, I do really think that
any reasonable policy/advice would take this into account. Otherwise, I'm going
to immediately assume that you're full of shit if you lack a sense of proportion
or if your models are not ranked by actual fucking impact. It's fine to
specialize in some area, but you most have a rational understanding of how your
area of expertise relates to the most critical parts of the overall system.
