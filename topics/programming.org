** Visualizing Source Code

*** [[github:githubocto/repo-visualizer][githubocto/repo-visualizer]]

[[https://githubnext.com/projects/repo-visualization][Visualizing a codebase]]

** Testing

For code comprehension, extrapolation or interviews

*** Red/Green Partial Diffs

I think this might be a good way to broaden younger programmers' exposure to
code or Open Source culture or Git Forge practices, regardless of whether this
is an app that would be used to test for comprehension.

The goal is not for a student/interviewee to "fix" the code or "find the bug" --
instead these would be intended to:

+ Require less time investment than later stage technical interviews (which may
  require 5+ hours ... of free work?)
+ Filter interviewees after or perhaps before initial phone screen.
+ Provide questions that mix some structure/grading with opportunity for
  open-ended responses.

Thus, the code should be fairly "normal" while the changeset is definitely
driven by a purpose. This could either be explained a diff that:

+ corrects a bug or adds a feature
+ illustrates a possible use case (either integration test or e2e test) changes
  an interface
+ expands potential for interaction between extant design patterns
+ expands CLI options, etc
+ creates inversion of control

... But you want a large base of source material, likely 1,000+ changesets:

+ some smaller fraction of which would be repeated
+ changesets can be tagged/categorized or scored according to difficulty

Draw testing material from somewhat complicated PRs or Diffs on Github where
many lines are changed in a small number of files.

+ Obscure 40-80% of either the diff's red lines or green lines or 20% of both
+ Ask the student/interviewer to identify missing functionality.
+ Press for reasoning, reaction time, potential social reception of the Diff/PR
  (e.g. there could be problems)
+ Ask for extrapolation of changes, code or future problems
+ Potentially ask the student/interviewer to add the missing lines or to outline
  the UML/Models for unspecified interfaces (outside of the context of the )

*Technically what I've described is basically Github ...*

#+begin_quote
I was thinking last night about the "nevers" and "havent' evers" and those
quantifiably infinitessimals ... I don't think I have ever seen a single Github
notification on my desktop. Not on MacOS, Not on Github. My browser
notifications have been misconfigured for some time. But yeh, there's not much
that draws me back into Github or grabs my attention when responses are needed.

/I don't have Windows, I don't have a tablet, I don't have the GH desktop app,
My old email account crashes every client I log into, I have never used the =gh=
CLI tool because I don't put authorization cookies in my home directory/.

So yeh, given how much time I wasted on social media, I definitly regret not
using Github socially or seeking out FOSS as a kind of social network.

* Pair Programming

** Apps

*** [[https://github.com/orgs/remotemobprogramming/repositories?type=all][mob.sh]]

The link points to a Github org that built mob.sh and the tools that surround
it. These are lightweight tools, which can be composed into a workflow.

+ [[https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/mob][remotemobprogramming/mob]] :: the main tool. Basically, a protocol where, given
  a branch prefix/name, then a group can collaborate on incremental commits. any
  kind of conference call, streaming, etc is completely outside it's area of concern.
+ [[https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/posignal][remotemobprogramming/posignal]] :: pull product owners into a Zoom
+ [[https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/timer][timer.mob.sh]] :: this is a shared "room" with just a timer & a list of users.

And editor plugins. Since these are simply wrappers around =mob= cli and since
mob.sh is just a wrapper around =git= index, refs and cli (mostly cli), then you
don't need the editor plugins necessarily.

*** Python

**** Where?

=java-antlr4-runtime-python= is used in:

+ [[https://cps.pages.gitlab.lrz.de/commonroad-route-planner/][CommonRoad's Route Planner]] for OmegaConf
+ [[https://github.com/notofonts/nototools][Nototools]] for Google's Noto font (for [[https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko][Adobe's font devkit]])

[[file:img/antlr4-revdeps.svg]]

***** OmegaConf

#+begin_quote
OmegaConf is a hierarchical configuration system, with support for merging
configurations from multiple sources (YAML config files, dataclasses/objects
and CLI arguments) providing a consistent API regardless of how the
configuration was created.
#+end_quote

Well that answers a really big question I've had (I think)... I just never
thought there was actually a practical answer.

#+begin_src python
import sys
import OmegaConf
# sys.argv = ["script.py", "srv.port=82"]
conf = OmegaConf.from_cli()
# conf == { srv: { port: 82 } } # basically
#+end_src

Variable interpolation: this lets you automagically use Python dataclasses
(instead of Ruby) to merge objects together, all in the pursuit of
re-implementing =&yml_std_features=. So far, anyways (see [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT_UIV7hCnquIbLUm4NnkUpXvPEh33IKiUEvPRF850WKA8opOlZOszjKdZ3tPmf8u7hGNP6HpqS-NT5/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g84632f636b_5_135][2.2 slides]]). Those don't
really scope beyond a single file though. Also:

+ string interpolation
+ custom resolvers: specification of functions in yaml
+ =env.VARS= resolver

It basically allows your python code to hint the order of evaluation when
merging configs

+ You can choose =DictConfig= or types
+ You can =freeze= objects before (or after?) merging them into a =StructuredConfig=
+ You can lazily evaluate environment or process-specific details

***** Antlr4 in OmegaConf

The grammar has already generated code in the project, which uses =antlr= to
ensure completeness of expressions contained in YAML.

+ [[https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/blob/fa8461729021558f19a538bcac789105c173637e/omegaconf/grammar_parser.py][./omegaconf/grammar_parser.py]]

**** Testing Enumeration of C++ headers

From [[https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/cpp/Python3][antlr/grammars-v4 ./cpp/Python3]]

#+begin_src shell

# the second one gives you the antlr4 python import
guix shell antlr4 java-antlr4-runtime-python python

lexer=CPP14Lexxer.g4
parser=CPP14Parser.g4

python3 transformGrammar.py
#+end_src

That ... does something:

#+begin_example diff

#+end_src

Just use =grep=. Parser doesn't =.parse()=. I just need to reflect across the parse
results. I don't really have time. For as many languages as there are examples,
IDK where to go to figure out how =antlr4= expects its generated grammars in each
langauge to behave -- there are about 10 languages per language.

+ [[https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/_scripts/templates/Python3/st.Test.py][_scripts/templates/Python3/st.Test.py]] this may help.
+ OmegaConf is like built like a machine ... I can't bounce around 50+ python
  files for =antlr= on a whim without some context clues.
