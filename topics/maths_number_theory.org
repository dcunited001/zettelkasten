[[wikipedia:Diophantine_geometry][Diophontine]]: just run away ... unless you encounter a Birch Swinnerton, then run
faster. Notice how Diophontine Geometry is in the main Wikipedia math categories
... but there's very, very little content for each of its "four fundamental
theorems" pages? ... Yeh, it's 2023. That's a bad sign.
