* IP4

* IP6
** Topics
*** IP6 addressing, subnetting & *-casting divvy up a hypergraph of networks
  - This is the "mathy" way to think of it when:
    - designing addressing schemes
    - designing application-level features that utilize the IP6 multicasting &
      subnetting
  - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft35bUVxiLQ&t=2489s][There be dragons]]: as the IP6 route/switch config becomes more complex, so
    do the devops, firewall rules & attack surfaces.
    - It should be more secure ... but not necessarily
    - Specifics?

** Issues
*** How to force IP6 on a network?
+ how to ensure internal devices are complying as expected?
*** How to detect NAT translated ports connecting via your router, initiated externally?
+ This will happen all the time...
  - but if I force IP6 internally and at least expect VPN/external connections
    to connect via IP6,
  - then this can distinguish computers/connections under my control from an
    attacker (who isn't aware of my preferences)
+ How to specify this with PFSense/Snort (or security onion) to sniff some
  matching patterns?
