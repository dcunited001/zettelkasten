*** Using Cisco's Next UI

[[https://habr.com/en/articles/534716/][Visualizing Network Topologies: Zero to Hero in Two Days]]

This tool was discontinued by Cisco quite a long time ago, but otherwise this
guide is fairly good.

*** OWASP Amass

*** Netplan

This eats YAML and generates network configuration for systemd-networkd &
network-manager... no idea how i never encountered this...

+ There's no AUR package ... but there is an arch package.

* NTP

** Docs

** Resources

** Tools

*** ntpq

For usage, see [[https://medium.com/@minimalist.ascent/exploring-ntp-servers-bf631074d403][enumerating NTP servers]]

On Guix, this is just in the =ntp= package.

Useful commands:

+ ntpq -c rv
+ ntpq -pn
+ ntpq -c sysinfo (and check the leap code)

* Infrastructure Layer

The not-quite-application ~layer~: names, load balancing, caching and transport
at this level provide essential abstractions for indirection. So they are
arguably more so networking than part of the application ... For now, until I
move them out.

This [[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005722/ethernet-products.html][Intel ethernet cards that support SR-IOV]] FAQ describes what to expect when
using SR-IOV. The Guest OS also needs Virtual Function (VF) drivers.

* Layer 3

** IP4

** IP6
*** Topics


**** Dynamic WAN Addresses

See this answer on [[https://superuser.com/questions/1479327/why-is-ipv6-still-dynamic][addresses and prefixes]] and this one on [[https://superuser.com/questions/1372769/ipv6-home-set-up-openwrt-18-06-1-how-to/1374251#1374251][DHCPv6 stateliness]]

#+begin_quote
The WAN's gonna give you an address. And you gonna go in there and be like
"what's your address" and the ISP router's gonna be all like "You can't tell me
what to do."
#+end_quote

.... not really though. Thank god they can't screw that up. I need to double
check this because doubling the IPv4 addressing on most of my interfaces might
not work.  The plan is to add a one-to-one IPv4 overlay using trunked vlans with
IP's to ping for test. This should be fairly trivial ... but there are
potentially address space conflicts, in addition to firewall issues.


**** IP6 addressing, subnetting & *-casting divvy up a hypergraph of networks
  - This is the "mathy" way to think of it when:
    - designing addressing schemes
    - designing application-level features that utilize the IP6 multicasting &
      subnetting
  - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft35bUVxiLQ&t=2489s][There be dragons]]: as the IP6 route/switch config becomes more complex, so
    do the devops, firewall rules & attack surfaces.
    - It should be more secure ... but not necessarily
    - Specifics?

*** Issues
**** How to force IP6 on a network?
+ how to ensure internal devices are complying as expected?
**** How to detect NAT translated ports connecting via your router, initiated externally?
+ This will happen all the time...
  - but if I force IP6 internally and at least expect VPN/external connections
    to connect via IP6,
  - then this can distinguish computers/connections under my control from an
    attacker (who isn't aware of my preferences)
+ How to specify this with PFSense/Snort (or security onion) to sniff some
  matching patterns?

* Layer 4

** TCP/UDP
