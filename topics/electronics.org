*** Installations


*** Issues
**** Kicad is unstable in sway
- =eeschema= leaves huge logs via sway (50 MB/hr)
- see EGL build details below ...
- =./libs/kiplatform/gtk/environment.cpp= implies that kicad sets =GDK_BACKEND=
  to =X11= when configuring =wxPython=.
- if the code in environment.cpp isn't also loaded by =eeschema= when it starts
  alone, then there is a chance that running kicad first will fix these
  stability problems



**** Building Kicad with EGL support (for wayland compat)
+ Doesn't matter: both fail and ... yeh. nope.
  + -DKICAD_USE_EGL :: requires that EGL is dynamically linkable into Kicad
    + this requires the system build of EGL/GLEW satisfy some build options
  + -KICAD_USE_BUNDLED_GLEW :: instead statically links a built EGL/GLEW kicad

* Sensors
** FBAR and SAW

By emitting and receiving an RF signal over a short "acoustic" gap (in a
peizoelectric substrate), a series of filters in a lattice topology can extract
information from the modulation of the peizoelectric substrate's length.

*** Detection of VOCs

So, by coating the piezoelectric substrate with a thin polymer coating, you can
create a "lab on a chip" that reacts to subtle length changes when the polymer
absorbs a target molecule. In other words it can detect the presence of volatile
organic compounds. See [[doi:10.1016/j.proche.2009.07.262][doi:10.1016/j.proche.2009.07.262]], Fully integrated FBAR
sensor matrix for mass detection.

Review]]

** Ferrofluid-based pressure sensor

*NOTE:* this is apparently now a thing, more or less. See the nuphy keyboard.

I was trying to think of alternative designs for keycaps with "springy-ness" and
for some reason ferrofluid popped into my head and the potential energy stored
in pressure is /somewhat/ similar to that of a spring. So I checked around and
found an example of the kind of switch I was thinkng of: [[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0960-1317/23/12/125031/pdf?casa_token=0Dh8XR60sSAAAAAA:5e71YLzLAv21uRyRHQKdisZ-iy83EoioQvhzfTSbEzyGlfjgYpvUqzxLAAuYJ8Xh-sVY1QMgbds2HzlKTdk][A ferrofluid-based
wireless pressure sensor]] (or doi://10.1088/0960-1317/23/12/125031) ... though
maybe I'm confabulating. It's possible it's been mentioned in class.

[[A ferrofluid-based wireless pressure sensor]] (or
doi://10.1088/0960-1317/23/12/125031) ... though maybe I'm confabulating.

It's an inductive switch, but actually in "open loop" configuration. The
sensor's coil doesn't even need to be connected to a circuit. It was laser cut using the same brand of ULS cutter we have at
the FabLab. It looks potentially cheap, depending on how the signal modulation
is _transduced_ into registering sensor activation.

*** Possible N/C configuration?

The following doesn't match up with the article above, since I wrote it before I
fully grokked the open loop configuration of their design ... I'm actually not
sure why i'm including it here other than it would be interesting to switch the
magnetic properties of a material on and off by confining particles to local
spaces.

+ If you applied some low level magnetic field on the ferrofluid, then it would
  have some large-scale alignment. If the mechanism forced most of the liquid
  into small inclusions/alcoves, then with large enough ferrofluid particle
  size, it should become impossible for the field effects to continuously stack
  from one region to another. The intended effect thereby would scatter the
  magnetic field and the inductor would instead look for a N/C (normally closed)
  effect -- i.e. it starts with some background magnetic field which scatters,
  causing the inductor's signal to drop out.
