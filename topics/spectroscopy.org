** Plants

*** Blueberries

These have a broad spectrum of anthocyanins, which apparently transmute
excitation by visible light around =~450nm= into orange and red.

**** Anthocyanin Variation

Particularly, variation in color intensity and the pigments' anatomical
distribution...

In other words, could I get /these/ blueberries to make a dye? According to the
article below, that is possible -- along with references to mordent used to tie
down the organic pigments. Some of these blueberrys only have pigment in the
skin.

  Blueberry Anthocynanins: A Review of Recent Advances]]
  (10.1016/j.jff.2021.104864)

Table 1 is the more valuable data here.

Another article more clearly to the point:

Ripening of Highbush Blueberry Cultivars Grown at Two Different Altitudes]]
(10.3389/fpls.2019.01045)

In case you're wondering ... mine do not look like this. They have plenty of
pigment on the surface, but almost none inside. Except the few that are mutants.

**** Nutritional Mechanisms

This one's probably from an industry plant (no pun intended), but still contains
a lot of info on mechanisms, uses, chemistry.

  the Development of Blueberries-Based Functional Foods: An Updated and

  blueberries]] (10.1111/1750-3841.16269)


** Human

*** Diagnostics

**** Biopsies

Things like this are trending (see hyperspectral stuff)

[[https://doi.org/10.1364/OPTICA.515501][Multi-scale tissue fluorescence mapping with fiber optic ultraviolet excitation
and generative modeling]] (10.1364/OPTICA.515501)

**** Informal Examination

***** TODO finish reading doi:10.3390/jcm13082422 fluoresence-guided laparoscopy

This is a bit hard to find info on sometimes, which is a bit surprising.

[[https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/8/2422][Fluorescence-Guided Laparoscopy after Oral Hypericin Administration for Staging of Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer]]

I didn't read the methods in detail, but

... but informal use of UV light is somewhat useful for the correct situations:

+ maybe extent of chemical exposure
+ checking for indirect contact
+ early detection of latent allergic response: skin tone darkens, reduces UVB
  fluorescence... though that's speculative.

Mainly, it's cheap, in time & money. It's difficult to interpret the chemistry,
if not impossible, so insights should stick to deviation from normal
presentation, general color, intensity and mostly localization/spread/assymetry.

Unfortunately, most things that glow are harmless. UV/Vis databases that are
worth a shit are few and far between. Access is certainly not free. It's
challenging to answer questions like "YTF do my spinach glow like that?" It's
orange bc there are one or two main strains of chlorophyll in most places -- but
good luck finding that bit of trivia.

Rarely do chemical bonds with larger molecules present distinct fluoresence --
e.g. maybe a leaking capacitor or leaking hydraulic fluid.

Other potential problems:

+ There's "no filter" process like triage or overall examination that would
  indicate that such a method is necessary ... so it's too easy for people to
  try themselves. I guess? IDK, it's a realistic problem.
+ UVC and UVB are carcinogenic and potentially damaging to tissues without
  melatonin (and esp to the eyes). Reflections are hard to calculate, esp if you
  don't feel well, and self-examination would usually occur in the bathroom
  (where it's potentially prompted without sterile conditions)

*** Skin

**** UVB can trigger some cHPA and subcutaneous immunological responses

I do feel like I can "feel" a UV LED, though it's mild.

*** Face

**** Sweat

What are the orange marks that appear at follicles & sweat glands? Is more worse
or better? It definitely shows up after a run. I'm a chemophobe, so i'd like to
know.

[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716140/][Fluorescent image analysis for evaluating the condition of facial sebaceous follicles]]

This apparently corresponds to sebum or bacteria, but it's tough to get a
conclusive answer on this. Science doesn't do much in the way of the
"subjectively accessible" ... which may be for the best.

It would be disturbing to see this: it doesn't appear in the usual UVA range,
AFAIK. You need a 265nm UV LED, preferably directional with control over
polarization (LED is polarized but doesn't usually allow for control over that).
