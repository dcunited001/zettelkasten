** High Entropy Alloys (HEA)

*** Explanation using "Face Alignments of Types of Vertex Sites In Penrose Tilings"

The shapes on the right are described in the image caption as an "Atlas of the
eight types of vertex sites encountered in the Penrose vertex model
tiling." [cite:@nakakuraziherl-2019-metal-mean-quasic]

High-entropy alloys must be composed of many types of 3D crystals that resemble
the above "types of 2D vertex sites." If it were possible to analyze any random
10nm snapshot of atoms in an HEA, there should be crystal faces and/or grain
boundaries:

+ That do not connect (detached or with gaps)
+ With high [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitaxy][epitaxial strain]] (or low)
+ With low energy above hull

The smaller the grains, the more complicated that the /types of interacting
crystal units/ may become.  So engineering these materials would involve
identifying processes which take the same ingredients but produce some
consistent distribution of these patterns or types of pairings.

Usually, this lack of regularity would create weakness, but occasionally the
change in dispersion of strain would increase strength or create other
possibilities for material properties.

**** Application in fusion

Critically, if the material is designed to withstand bombardment by neutrons (as
occurs in the shielding for fusion reactors), then the material is already
disordered. If the material retains its strength -- while the fusion-facing side
experiences increasing disorder -- then an HEA could be useful. One of the main
design challenges for tokamaks is increasing the materials strength for the
large, high-strength magnetic fields required for plasma confinement.

Though neutron radiation would be halted before it penetrates deeply into a
material, if the material doesn't contribute to the function (strength/etc) or
can't easily be replaced (can't be detached), this is kind of a show-stopper for
fusion.
