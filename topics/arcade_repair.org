** Arcade Diagnostics Checklist
*** Check that Fuses are Correct/Connected
Should probably be slow blow and labeled SB
*** Clean Board of Dust, Contaminants & Flux
+ The contaminants will reflow, creating unintentional solder joints
+ Use an old paintbrush for the dusty stuff
+ A fiber
*** Check For Broken Solder Joints/Pads
+ Use a UV light at each stage to spot invisible problems or get insight into
  previous repairs/reflow attempts
+ May need to use the meter at this stage
*** Check the Voltage Regulator
+ OL resistance on input/output/? indicates a short
+ Then check voltage drops on other pin combinations. Values should be within
  reasonable ranges.
*** Check High-Watt Resistors
*** Check Caps
+ look for leaking acid/corrosion
+ Can use a fiberglass pen to touch up corrosion

Also check the Critical Safety caps. The pins on the outside should be shorted,
but the lengthwise pins should not be connected.
*** Check HOT (horizontal output transformer)
 using diode meter, negative on the middle, other pins should read approx 0.5V drop
*** Check Diodes
Should read a reasonable 0.7V or similar
*** Check Flyback
+ Check pins for continuity to their downstream connections.

Not sufficient for full test.

** Redemption Diagnostics Checklist
*** Check For Potential Mechanical Problems First
Ensure that the power requirements for mechanical devices are not outside
of a reasonable range.

- e.g. if there's a pair of skeeball machines, when too many balls are on one
  side, that solenoid's physical work is perhaps multiplied by a factor of two.

Ensure proper lubrication of parts -- use the correct lubrication for the part!

Check for paint or metal that's scraping off.

+ If you're enlightened by the [[id:eae4d931-5fc3-40a5-a256-b3642d090921][Philosophy of Forensics]] then the distribution
  of matter indicates causality: every single piece of physical matter conveys
  information.
+ This reference to forensic science, obviously, means means use the finger test. Corallary: don't use the
  finger test if you don't want to lose the ability to make causal inferences
  later.

Similarly check interfaces between mechanical parts which show excessive
wear or friction.

** Tools

Not complete lists

+ Fiberglass pen :: clean board without excessive friction/abrasion
+ TPG Board :: for troubleshooting Video Control (on oldschool CRT repair)

*** Reflow
+ A nice desolderer :: makes cold solder-joints less of a ... /nightmare/
+ Isopropyl Alcohol
+ GLOVES

** Monitor Repair

*** Power On Checklist

1) Anode
2) Neck Board
3) Yoke
4) Ground
5) Power
6) Video
7) Remote

Other tips:
- Never power up without a remote
