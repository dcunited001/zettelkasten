** Arcade Diagnostics Checklist
*** Check that Fuses are Correct/Connected
Should probably be slow blow and labeled SB
*** Clean Board of Dust, Contaminants & Flux
+ The contaminants will reflow, creating unintentional solder joints
+ Use an old paintbrush for the dusty stuff
+ A fiber
*** Check For Broken Solder Joints/Pads
+ Use a UV light at each stage to spot invisible problems or get insight into
  previous repairs/reflow attempts
+ May need to use the meter at this stage
*** Check Other Sources of Discontinuity
+ check resistance
+ can also check connection to ground (resistance check, phone a friend)

*** Check the Voltage Regulator
+ OL resistance on input/output/? indicates a short
+ Then check voltage drops on other pin combinations. Values should be within
  reasonable ranges.
*** Check High-Watt Resistors

*** Check Caps
+ look for leaking acid/corrosion
+ Can use a fiberglass pen to touch up corrosion
+ Look for caps that have either been replaced or that havent
+ It's not necessary to immediately replace faulty caps ... unless it is to
  power on.

**** Check the Critical Safety caps.

The pins on the outside should be shorted, but the lengthwise pins should not be
connected.

*** Check Power Regulation
+ Ensure filter caps are connected/good.
+ Ensure mosfets are the mosfet's you think they are.
  - check voltage drops in diode mode.



*** Check HOT (horizontal output transformer)
 using diode meter, negative on the middle, other pins should read approx 0.5V drop
*** Check Diodes
Should read a reasonable 0.7V or similar
*** Check Flyback
+ Check pins for continuity to their downstream connections.

Not sufficient for full test.
** Light Bulb Test
+ [[https://forums.arcade-museum.com/threads/hv-shutdown-lightbulb-test-for-different-monitor-chassis.448516/][Lightbulb Test on U5000]] (hv shutdown)
  - [[https://forums.arcade-museum.com/threads/k7401-with-high-b.393513/][On K7401 (with High B+)]]

Doesn't work in every situaton:
+ $V_{p2p}$ should be ~169V, pre-transformer
+ This requires isolating the voltage regulation or power supply by
  disconnecting some components.
+ It could be dangerous, depending on voltage/frequency.

Includes quote on HOT test, indicating

#+begin_quote
"If the HOT tests shorted in circuit and fine out of circuit you have a short on
the B+ rail you need to find."

When checking the HOT in circuit you will see a short from the base to
emitter. This is because you are measuring across T701's secondary winding and
L704 which is basically a short. The only way to check it in circuit is to place
your positive lead (red) to the tab of the HOT (collector) and the negative lead
(black) to ground. High resistance good, short probably bad. Still the best way
to check if the HOT is good or bad is to remove and test.

** Redemption Diagnostics Checklist
*** Check For Potential Mechanical Problems First
Ensure that the power requirements for mechanical devices are not outside
of a reasonable range.

- e.g. if there's a pair of skeeball machines, when too many balls are on one
  side, that solenoid's physical work is perhaps multiplied by a factor of two.

Ensure proper lubrication of parts -- use the correct lubrication for the part!

Check for paint or metal that's scraping off.

+ If you're enlightened by the [[id:eae4d931-5fc3-40a5-a256-b3642d090921][Philosophy of Forensics]] then the distribution
  of matter indicates causality: every single piece of physical matter conveys
  information.
+ This reference to forensic science, obviously, means means use the finger test. Corallary: don't use the
  finger test if you don't want to lose the ability to make causal inferences
  later.

Similarly check interfaces between mechanical parts which show excessive
wear or friction.

*** Then Run The Parts of the Arcade Diagnostics Checklist
Not everything is applicable -- e.g. tests for the components relating to CRT
monitor.

*** Check Isolated Components, If Possible
You should be able to test DC components when:

+ you have a lab bench power supply with suffcient power/volt/amp output
+ you've can disconnected the part from it's mechanical interface and
  electrical connections.

** Tools

Not complete lists

+ Fiberglass pen :: clean board without excessive friction/abrasion
+ TPG Board :: for troubleshooting Video Control (on oldschool CRT repair)

*** Reflow
+ A nice desolderer :: makes cold solder-joints less of a ... /nightmare/
+ Isopropyl Alcohol
+ GLOVES

** Monitor Repair

*** Power On Checklist

1) Anode
2) Neck Board
3) Yoke
4) Ground
5) Power
6) Video
7) Remote

Other tips:
- Never power up without a remote
