*** Shell Profile

**** Inheriting VSCodium Environment

Terminals come up with the expected =$PATH=, but tasks that are launched do
not. The processes are spawning s.t. they do not have parts of =.bashrc=. This
actually may be desirable, but is a bit confusing.

+ Install the [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rogalmic.bash-debug][Bash Debug]]
+ Create a executable bash script
+ Create a bash debug profile
+ Set a breakpoint
+ In the debug console, evaluate =$PATH=

The easy way around this is to set =terminal.integrated.inheritEnv=false=, but
this could cause issues if VSCode expects a clean environment.
