I have no idea why a visible-light spectroscopic database was so hard to come
by, but I couldn't find this before. I'm guessing it's because art/paint
suppliers will basically pay you /not/ to do this.

+ [[https://chsopensource.org/pigments-checker/][Pigment Checker]] includes many free resources on Raman, XRF, FTIR, and
  Reflectance Spectroscopy.
+ The [[https://chsopensource.org/download/23968/?tmstv=1700255640][Gorgias database]] contains reflectance spectroscopy data collected via the
  [[https://chsopensource.org/reflectance-spectroscopy-system/][Gorgias spectrometer]]. There are multiple links to the database.
