** Pigments

*** CHOS

I have no idea why a visible-light spectroscopic database was so hard to come
by, but I couldn't find this before. I'm guessing it's because art/paint
suppliers will basically pay you /not/ to do this.

+ [[https://chsopensource.org/pigments-checker/][Pigment Checker]] includes many free resources on Raman, XRF, FTIR, and
  Reflectance Spectroscopy.
+ The [[https://chsopensource.org/download/23968/?tmstv=1700255640][Gorgias database]] contains reflectance spectroscopy data collected via the
  [[https://chsopensource.org/reflectance-spectroscopy-system/][Gorgias spectrometer]]. There are multiple links to the database.

* Resources

This is more appropriate for art.

* Art Conservation

** Chemistry

*** Paint Consolidants

* Medium

** Oil

*** Chemistry

Somehow either =org-ref= or =citar= or =org-export= should format the citekey
links ... but I need to reinforce other features first. Whenever I use this,
it's always for some passing interest.

*Electrochemical Assessment of Pigments-Binding Medium Interactions in Oil Paint
Deterioration: a Case Study on Indigo and Prussian Blue*

[cite:@domenech-carbodomenech-carbo-2020-elect-asses-pigmen]

** Support

*** Metallic

**** The degradation of oil painted copper support

From 2006, but discusses the electrochemical basis for adhesion of oil paint to
metallic mediums. [cite:@pavlopoulouwatkinson-2006-degrad-oil-paint]

**** Consolidants for treatment of oil paintings on copper support

*A technical investigation of an oil painting on copper support, including a
study on consolidants for treatment.* [cite:@oliveira-2015-techn-inves-oil]

A thesis on conservation, but it covers a lot of history & chemistry.

**** Multi-spectroscopic Approach for Paintings on Metal Surfaces

*Multi-Spectroscopic Approach for the Non-invasive Characterization of Paintings
on Metal Surfaces* [cite:@albiniridolfi-2020-multi-spect-approac]

Probably details electrochemical basis for adhesion to metallic mediums (I
haven't read these)
