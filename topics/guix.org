What this article does very well: describes first and second-order responses to
using Guix for 6+ months -- i.e. it assumes you can find the "how" elsewhere and
gives an honest look at the "why". Almost entirely positive. High-level
discussion of actual problems encountered and solutions found.

* Code

Apparently you can create a uboot image that runs on NES.

** Bootloader

*** ./gnu/bootloader.scm
+ all-modules
+ bootloader-modules
+ efi-bootloader-chain
  - assembles the final-bootloader
  - can include files
  -
+ efi-bootloader-profile
  - derivations built into a profile

+ records:
  - bootloader
  - bootloader-configuration

*** ./gnu/bootloader/*.scm
Contains code that processes bootloader packages to prepare for installation
after derivation.

*** Bootloader Packages
**** ./gun/packages/bootloaders.scm
Packages that build bins for bootloaders to install

+ make-grub-efi-netboot
  - this demonstrates a gexp derivation that operates on a =grub-efi= package to
    produce netboot *.efi artifacts.

*** Making a diskless netboot image

There are several points where boot/network could fail:

+ inconsistencies in the handoff between boot stages
+ [[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Diskless_nodes#Configure_diskless_networking][reconfiguration of network]] (without killing NFS connection)
+ inconsistent fstab or disk state

Several artifacts would be produced:

+ potentially a iPXE/gPXE like config to instruct the client to run a binary
  (and/or to provide m)
+ an image to serve via TFTP
+ a squashfs filesystem to serve via NFS

This would require:

+ requires tweaking make-grub-efi-netboot or reimplementing a similar process to
  produce the net variant of a bootloader.
+ if possible use squashfs instead of initramfs?
  - this requires kernel modules & args
  - this compresses as content is needed
    - problems with hardlinked files?
+ at this point, device state needs to be persisted
+ a separate squashfs will need to be pulled from a server
  - something besides NFS... though TFTP has size limitations
  - The new RFC bumps the block size to 65464 from 512-8192, but getting these
    sizes [[https://www.compuphase.com/tftp.htm][requires adjusting MTU]]. In theory, this would extend up to 4GB, but in
    practice ~100MB is practical (from MTU-overhead=1468).
  - gPXE supports HTTPS, but there's no Guix package for it
  - a syslinux package exists, but there are similar problems. NFS may be necessary.
+ to assemble the filesystem image served from NFS(? i don't like NFS)
+ something like busybox =switch_root= is needed to create a new fileroot
  - this will happen twice during boot, but the configuration to do so is split
    into pieces.
+ device state needs to be checked/persisted

** Locale

[[https://stackoverflow.com/a/7934397][Everything you never wanted to know about unicode normalization]]


** Development Environments
*** Customizations to a project's =guix.scm= or =manifest.scm= for =guix shell=
This is a similar approach, but done with [[https://discourse.nixos.org/t/local-personal-development-tools-with-flakes/22714/6][nix flakes]].

+ a file =extra/nix.flake= is created that inherits from the root =nix.flake=
+ it's added to the git index, but not visible to the git commits ... (didn't
  know this was possible)

** Nonfree Software
*** Dynamically Linking lib64

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/GUIX/comments/11iaov9/comment/jbh8u04/?context=3][This reddit comment]] recommends:

#+begin_src scheme
(extra-special-file "/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2"
                    (file-append glibc "/lib/ld-linux-x64-64.so.2")
#+end_src

And then set =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= as needed.

#+begin_src shell :eval no
if [[ $- == *i* ]]
then
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH
fi
#+end_src

I'm not sure about setting it in =.bashrc= like that.

** Emacs Guix
*** Can't get a guix repl up from within doom emacs (11/2022)
+ initially, it seemed there was a conflict between the geiser and emacs-guix
  sourced by doom-emacs and the emacs-native-comp manifest i use
  - doom emacs was pulling down emacs-guix and geiser.
  - removed =(scheme +guile)= from init.el, assuming that
  - resynced the emacs-native-comp, deleted all =*.elc= files, updated doom, ran
    =doom build=, waited and restarted the server.
  - here, it worked.

after restarting, it doesn't work:

#+begin_example
in procedure package0name: Wrong type argument: #<package abduco@0.6, gnu/packages/abduco.scm>""
#+end_example

it seems to crash pretty early

*** DONE Getting the guile environment working for emacs-native-comp on arch
CLOSED: [2022-12-04 Sun 08:01]
+ there are inconsistencies between the emacs build for arch and the one for
  guix. to simplify, i'm simply using the one from guix on both systems.
  - emacs-guix has never worked properly on arch, which is a matter of
    reconciling the system's guile config. on guix, I can just count on the
    system guile being ready to go and i haven't messed with it much. on arch,
    guile is required for quite a few things (gdb, kde error reports)

**** Resolution:

Emacs guix needs a consistent guile environment (See [[https://github.com/alezost/guix.el#important-note-for-non-guix-system-users][this note]]).

- also, running =doom purge= when moving emacs packages between guix and
  doom's straight is essential. any shared dependencies will likely be brought
  in from doom (not guix)
- in other words ... you kinda must pick a team (or micromanage your
  =EMACSLOADPATH=)

And nothing I was doing while rebuilding guix manifests and upgrading/rebuilding
doom emacs was actually doing anything (on either arch or guix...)

* Installations
** Arch

**** Run the initial =guix pull=
+ =guix describe= doesn't work
+ Authorize guix substitutes from main Guix channel
+ Run =systemctl enable/start guix-daemon.service= then =guix pull=

**** Setup SystemD
+ The AUR package has set up systemd to launch under root.
  - The systemd service files will need to be updated
+ The =guix-daemon-latest.service= needs a path to be edited.
  - In =/usr/lib/systemd/system/guix-daemon-latest.service=, edit the
    =Service.ExecStart= variable: set the correct path for the user that
    installed Guix.
+ Disable/stop =guix-daemon= and switch over to =guix-daemon-latest=
  - This daemon runs a profile that was constructed via =guix pull=
  - When this profile is active
    - =.config/guix/current/bin/guix describe= should work properly

**** Configure =$PATH=
+ Set path to point =guix= binary to the one in =.config/guix/current/bin/=

**** Add custom channels

**** Tune Guix configuration
+ refine options for =guix-daemon=
+ configure substitutes for various packages

**** TODO Hack on a package within an isolated environment
