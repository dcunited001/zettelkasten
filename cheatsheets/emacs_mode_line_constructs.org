#+CATEGORY: slips
#+TAGS:

From [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#g_t_0025_002dConstructs][24.4.5 %-Constructs in the Mode Line]]

Strings used as mode line constructs can use certain %-constructs to substitute
various kinds of data. The following is a list of the defined %-constructs, and
what they mean.

| %b | The current buffer name, obtained with the buffer-name function. See Buffer Names.                |
| %c | The current column number of point, counting from zero starting at the left margin of the window. |
| %C | The current column number of point, counting from one starting at the left margin of the window.  |
| %e | Warns if Emacs is nearly OOM for lisp objects                                                     |
| %f | =buffer-file-name=                                                                                |
| %F | The title (on a window system) or name of selected frame                                          |
| %i | Size of accessible buffer. Basically =(- (point-max) (point-min))=                                |
| %I | Like =%i= but human readable                                                                      |
| %l | Current line number of point                                                                      |
| %M | Value of =global-mode-string=, part of =mode-line-misc-info=                                      |
| %n | =Narrow= when narrowing is in effect. See =narrow-to-region=                                      |
| %o | Percentage of travel through visible buffer                                                       |
| %p | Percentage of buffer text above top of window                                                     |
| %P | Percentage of buffer text above the bottom of window                                              |
| %q | Percentages of text above top and bottom of window                                                |
| %s | =process-status= Status of current buffer's subprocess                                            |
| %z | Mnemonics of keyboard, terminal, and buffer coding systems                                        |
| %Z | Like =%z= but includes =end-of-line= format                                                       |
| %* | =%= read only; =*= modified; =-= otherwise                                                        |
| %+ | =*= modified =%= read only =-= otherwise                                                          |
| %& | =*= modified; =-= otherwise                                                                       |
| %@ | =@= if =default-directory= is remote; =-= otherwise                                               |
| %[ | One =[= for each recursive editing level                                                          |
| %] | One =]= for each recursive editing level                                                          |
| %- | Fill remainder with =-= dashes                                                                    |
| %% | Literal =%=                                                                                       |

+ In any construct except =%%=, you can add a decimal integer after =%= to specify
  a minimum field width. If the width is less, the field is padded to that
  width.
+ Purely numeric constructs -- =%c=, =%i=, =%I=, and =%l= -- are padded by
  inserting spaces to the left, and others are padded by inserting spaces to the
  right.
