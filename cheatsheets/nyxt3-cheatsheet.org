#+AUTHOR:    David Conner

#+DESCRIPTION: notes

**** TODO maybe add support for the =nyxt:= url protocol, at least within emacs.

* Nyxt

** Useful Functionality

(besides the obvious)

*** The Essentials

I was going to title this section "Indoor Plumbing"

**** Hinting

Jump to hints avy-style

+ =bookmark-hint=

**** Panels

Custom side panels

+ =headings-panel=
+ =buffers-panel=

**** Navigation

next/previous-heading with =M-{= and =M-}=

+ jump-to-heading-buffers :: use =C-M-h= to jump to headers across a set (?) of buffers
+ jump-to-heading ::

**** User Scripts

The docs include examples for [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation#user-scripts][running GreaseMonkey scripts]]

*** Extras

Some of these are good examaples of custom scripts

**** Macros

+ edit-macro :: no-code interface to record macros (or to discover function names)

**** Passthrough


Useful for games, apps or editors that have keybinding conflicts

+ =passthrough-mode= =C-M-z=

**** Cruise Control

Autoscroll the content. Keys:

+ =n= increase velocity
+ =p= decrease velocity
+ =0= zero the velocity
+ =escape= exit the mode

**** Watch Mode

Refresh page every 5 seconds.

**** [[nyxt:describe-package?package=%1Bnyxt%2Fmode%2Fprocess%3A%3Anyxt%2Fmode%2Fprocess][Process Mode]]

In addition to what's listed below, this can be used for things like:

+ watching for file-changes to a latex document you're working on in emacs.
+ running =top= to watch IPC or processes

#+begin_quote
Conditionally execute a file/directory-related action in a separate thread.

Possible applications:
- Web server.
- Live preview of documents (nyxt/mode/preview).
- Refreshing a URL at regular intervals (nyxt/mode/watch).
- Live tracking of filesystem/data in a file/directory.

The mode itself should not be used directly. Rather, it should be subclassed and
extended with custom logic.
#+end_quote

***** TODO how to use process mode while avoiding the possibility of command injection?

Generally I need to find out

**** No Script Mode

Disable javascript (needs to be disabled per-host)

* Keybindings

** Transforming buffers

After selecting the text, run these with =query-replace[-regexp]=. The text uses
tabs =^I= to separate most fields, so these can be used when inserting pipes for
tables. Insert =^I= with =C-q C-i= and newlines =^J= with =C-q C-j=.

+ =Binding^ICommand^IDocumentation^J= →
+ =^\(.*-map\)= → =*** \1=
+ =^\(.*\)^I\(.*\)( \(.*\) )^I\(.*\)$= → =| \1 | \2 | \3 | \4 |=

And it should be done.
