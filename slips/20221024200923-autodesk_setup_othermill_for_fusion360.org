* Resources

+ Using Othermill Fusion (guide 1, guide 2)
  - includes the Bantam Othermill Library for Fusion360


** Fusion360: find machine definitions

Go to [[https://cam.autodesk.com/machineslist][Machine Library for Fusion360]]

** Fusion360: find cutting tool definitions

Go to [[https://cam.autodesk.com/hsmtools][Tools for Autodesk Fusion 360]]

** Fusion360: find post-processors

Go to [[https://cam.autodesk.com/hsmposts][Post Library for Autodesk Fusion 360]]

*** TODO figure out how to configure these as a machine in Fusion

* Issues

** Inkscape doesn't really merge layers

+ it's difficult to cut out hollow shapes from an "engraving" inkscape layer.
  - the proper way to do this is to trace the bitmap.
+ The correct tool for this is the laser cutter

** Setting up the tool library in fusion

After downloading the bantam tool library:

+ Click setup, right click library (under local) and import the tool library file

** Identifying/Measuring unknown bits and adding them as tools in Fusion360

+ Some of the bits are labeled & barcoded. None of them have Bantam packaging on
  them. Their site doesn't display packaging. I checked unboxing videos, but
  couldn't find anything.
+ The stats for bits can be found if they can be looked up.
  - Fusion360 contains a preview for bits that have been entered into its
    library, but regardless, the parameters must be adjusted for the machine
    (and material) that they are run in.

*** Kyocera [[https://www.travers.com/product/kyocera-cm-045l150-chamfering-mill-20-517-751][045L150]] 1/8 Chamfer 45

+ Coated with [[https://ruko.de/en/blog/altin-the-aluminium-titanium-nitrite-coating][AlTiN]] (sub-micron carbide)
+ can cut steel up to 900Â°C

*** Entering in Fusion

*** Exporting Tool Definition

** TODO setup a basic 2D milling plan

*** configure the stock/setup

*** setting up a basic 2D pocket

*** running the post-processor

*** exporting the gcode

*** importing to bantam

+ reentring the stock
+ probing routines?
