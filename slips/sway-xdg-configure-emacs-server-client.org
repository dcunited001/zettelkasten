* Status
** Emacsserver can now load from systemd



* Remaining Issues


** TODO add templates for =emacs.*.service= to source control
** TODO add templates for =emacs.*.desktop= to source control
+ this is partially done
+ [ ] remove stale links




** Emacsclient can't access Sourcecode Pro font & crashes
Resolved (removed it and ensured a guix/emacs-accessible font was loaded)

** Emacsclient can't be started from XDG desktop

It crashes and the server logs this issue

#+begin_example
Unable to init server: Broadway display type not supported: $DISPLAY
#+end_example

*** The solution was to remove $DISPLAY from the *.desktop params (it's xserver)

** Systemd can't start the default =emacs.service= or =emacs.fg.service= files

+ The default format for the systemd service seems to have been incorrect (it
  was =Type=notify= and backgrounded)
+ There may have been a different issue with the examples posted for the
  =--daemon= invoked =emacs.service=
  + or it may simply be unstable in sway/pGTK
  + it could have also been a font issue

** ... but the moral of the story is: I_CAN_NOW_READ_CRASH_LOGS....
+ or even submit them...

* Overview

I tried opening emacsclient from the terminal. This works, whether the running
server has an environment spawned pre-WM or post-Sway

*** Differences b/w systemd --user environment and the shell environment that spawns post-sway:

+ To test this, i ran emacs as daemon from a separate VTY, which has mostly the
  same env output as my systemd unit.
+ This is probably not an issue, but there are still some Wayland/GTK-specific
  environment variables that need to be tuned for the Emacs server process

*** Problems with the systemd unit.

+ The one created by arch references =/usr/bin/emacs --fg-daemon= instead of
  =--daemon= like most online examples.
  - SystemD tracks the processes it spawns, so I'm not sure it matters except
    for input/output handling.

*** (3) Problems with Guix

I think I've got this handled. I changed the =emacs.service= definition, so that
it references =/home/me/.guix-profile/bin/emacs --daemon=. Guix does modify the
paths for bash, man & info, so i still have to fix that.

*** (4) Problems with the XDG =emacsclient.desktop= file(s)

My =emacs.service= unit never fully activates when i start it, whether it is
running with =--daemon= or =--fg-daemon=.

- When I try a client in the terminal, that's fine.
- When I try via an XDG startup item, the =systemctl --user start emacs.service=
  errors out. this =systemctl= process never actually completes activation which
  i checked with =systemctl --user status emacs.service=.

*** (5) Problems with how =nwggrid= and =wofi= interact with XDG spec-defined processes (like running desktop items, etc)

+ i have had problems where =wofi= isn't starting processes properly.
  - so when i try to run =nnn= or =htop= using the =$mod+d= shortcut in sway
    (mapped to wofi), nothing happens.
  - when i try to run them with =nwggrid=, the terminal-oriented applications
    like =nnn= and =neovim= start just fine.

* Issues

*** Debugging XDG

**** TODO add info on =xdg-desktop-validate= and other tools

*** Wayland Display
+ does the emacs server need to know this?
  - if so, variables like =$DISPLAY= must be set before it starts

**** TODO fix =.desktop= so it starts emacs using =--display= param when =$@= files are not passed.
- [ ] copy a template to dotfiles

*** Misc
+ The =systemctl --user= service environment can be rectified with =bash -l -c=
+ XDG =.desktop= entries must escape bash vars with =\\$FOOBAR=
  - ...and they MUST be quoted
