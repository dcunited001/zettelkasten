* Setup Tasks

This is a list of tasks to overview for a new user of the othermill.

** Docs/Safety

** Installing Tools

** Understanding the work surface

*** Probing Brackets

+ The othermill has 3 separate kits that its software will probe for:
  - PCB
  - L-Bracket
  - ???

*** Affixing Media

**** Adhesives

**** Jigs

**** Fixturing

** Parts Check

** Jogging

** Selecting Media

** Selecting Tools

* Initial Test/Runthrough

After learning about the above, someone who is able to use the othermill should
be able to complete this process on their own.

+ Ensure that the required parts are included.
  - Without removing the tool, note its type
+ Connect & Start the device
  - Plug in power/usb.  Open Bantam Software. Turn on the mill. Note the Mill ID#
+ Update Firmware.
  - If this is necessary, the Bantam Tools Software will indicate this to you.
    If not, this can be found in the settings
  - This process is done through the Bantam Tools Software.
+ Check for anything obstructing the movement of the bed or
  spindle. if anything is left in the othermill while its running:
  - this could be a projectile risk
  - it could break the tool
  - it could damage the stepper motors.
  - it will probably damage your workpiece ...
  - this is a litmus for safety on other machines. if you cannot operate this
    device properly, you should not use more sophisticated/dangerous devices.
+ Autohome the device (after checking the bed)
  - this ensures the motors/sensors are okay
+ Remove the bit and check for damage
  - it's important to be careful when removing the tool
  - cup your hand under the tool and ensure it _does not_ fall and contact metal.
  - if you are not sure you can do this, you must use foam or some other soft
    material to catch the tool.
  - if the tool falls and makes contact with the aluminum bed _a single time_,
    this is more than enough to damage the cutting edge on the tool. it is
    ceramic.

+ If this is the first time the mill has run since a bracket has be installed,
  you must run the install process.
  - The mill must display the fixture that is installed in it (if there is a PCB
    bracket in the device, it should display in the graphics on the software.)
  - This information seems to be locally stored on the mill, so it will persist
    as you move the device from one Bantam Installation to another.
  - When you install the PCB Bracket (and others), you must run through the
    "install tool" process with the toolbit flipped upside down
    - it must be carefully pushed to the top of the spindle.

+ Examine & measure the stock

+ Run through

* Software

** Design

+ Inkscape
+ Fusion 360

** Mill

+ Fusion CAM :: use the manufacturing tab
+ Bantam
  - basic SVG :: black and white. vector graphics only
  - Advanced SVG :: four operations can be specified

**** TODO describe the design workflows more fully

* Workflows

** Inkscape (SVG or Color SVG)
Beginner to intermediate

This is appropriate for your first project

**** TODO describe SVG encoding limitions

** Fusion 360 (CAM)
Intermediate - Advanced

This must not be your first project

** KiCAD/Eagle/Solidworks

Advanced (Milling PCB's requires extra precautions (materials can be toxic)

*** SVG

*** Gerber files
