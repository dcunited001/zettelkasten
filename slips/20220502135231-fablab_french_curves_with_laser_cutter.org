#+title: Fablab: French Curves with Laser Cutter 

+ [[id:174967d0-1454-4bc6-aa88-8ec007496470][Fablab Projects]]

* Design
+ cut gear teeth into french curves (use python stl library or something)

** Math
+ this [[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-mathematical-function-that-describes-the-French-curve][quora answer]] describes french curves
  - technically, they are not bezier curves
  - they are multiple curves composed together at points were curvature K is equal (... or sometimes not)
  - the component curves are drawn from scalings of Euclid's spiral, the curvature for which varies linearly
    - i.e. =K(f(x)) = C*k= where k is a curvature parameter and C is a constant
+ this [[https://www.woodtalkonline.com/topic/15903-french-vs-bezier-curves/][woodtalk post]] covers the differences b/w french curves and bezier splines and mentions an inkscape plugin ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk-rSJSuCQ8][video]])

* Python

** SciPy

=scipy.special.fresnel= is needed. superimposing both integrals gives the
euler/cornu spirals.
