#+title: On Theoretical Cyncialisticism

* Cynical Theories
caution: almost everything in here is a quote or close paraphrase

*** Questions
- sovereign nations trojan horse video
  - James Lindsay's example of a way to distinguish someone who is
    well-meaning and someone who is divisively applying ideologies,
    including critical theory.

*** Questions from the Audience
**** how to stop the politicized Social Justice movement? (one ring metaphor)
- dismantle the people who are most active

**** on changing peoples minds
- provoke existential self-reflection with rhetoric that appeals to:
  - the absurdity
  - provokes a gag reflex
  - humor

*** postmodernism as a kind of "acid" for disassembling/reassembling culture
** Misc notes
- "anti-essentialist"

** Introduction
- specific definitions:
  - liberalism
  - critical theory
- john rowles
- henry gereau
- critical pedagogy
- bella dodd (communist plan from the 30's & 40's)
- alchemy (Soros)

** waffling ( epistemic authority )
** (1) Postmodernism
- key ideas of postmodernists of 1960's & 1970's
  - two principles and four themes
- four themes
  - skepticism about objective reality
  - perception of language as the constructor of knowledge
  - making of the individual
  - the role played by power in the above
- earliest evidence (including Borges) can be traced back to the 40's
  - but this book is concerned with the changes in the 60's
- distinction between early italian, american and french postmodern
  thinkers
  - italians tended "to foreground it's aesthetic elements"
  - americans were concerned about practical
  - french postmodernists were more concerned about social consequences
- after the first/second world wars, europeans' confidence in progress
  had been shaken. they were forced to reassesss the role of technology
  in our lives.
  - european academics had become skeptical of the liberalism and
    western civilization (which had led to the rise of fascism &
    communism)
  - colonialism was no longer "morally tenable"
  - there was an influx of migrants, who were formerly imperial
    subjects. their increasing presence drew european focus to the
    problems of colonialism, racism and inequality.
  - the left became disillusioned with Marxism & communism, which they
    had previously advanced as the ideological champion of progressivism
- baudulaire described three levels of "simulacra" (copies of things
  without true originals): premodern, modern & postmodern.
  - premodern: before enlightenment thought revolutionized our
    relationship to knowledge, unique realities existed (and people
    tried to represent them)
  - modern: mass production: each original could therefore have many
    copies
  - postmodern: there is no original and "all is simulacra",
    unsatisfactory imitations of the real
- giles deleuze and guittari argued that "the self was being constrained
  by capitalist/consumerist society"
  - frederic jameson deplored the shallowness of contemperary society

**** 2 principles and 4 themes
sideman (1994) & anderson (1996): "we are in the midst of a great
confusing, stressful and promising historical transition" - "not so much
in what we believe but how we believe", epistemologically, "shifts in
belief about belief" - science produced knowledge about objective
reality, allowing modernism to come into existence

- two principles
  - postmostdernist thinkers approach the rejection of modernism &
    enlightenment thought, esp with regard to universal truths,
    objective knowledge & individual ways in strikingly different themes
  - 1 (regarding knowledge): radical skepticism about whether objective
    knowledge/truth is obtainable (and a commitment to cultural
    constructivism)
  - 2 (regarding politics): society is formed of systems of power and
    hierarchies, which determine what can be known and how
- four themes (again?)
  - 
    1) the blurring of boundaries
  - 
    2) [@2] the power of language
  - 
    3) [@3] cultural relativism
  - 
    4) [@4] the loss of the individual and the universal
- these 2 principles and 4 themes have mostly remained unchanged, even
  as postmodernism has evolved from its deconstructive beginnings of
  (...) to today's strident and almost religious political activism
  - these are the core principles of theory

**** the postmodern knowledge principle
**** the postmodern political principle
** (2) Postmodernism's Applied Turn
- "how these ideas mutated mutated, solidified and were made politically
  actionable"
  - "applied postmodernism"

** (3) Postcolonial Theory
** (4) Queer Theory
** (5) Critical Race Theory and Intersectionality
** (6) Feminisms and Gender Studies
** (7) Disabilities and Fat Studies
** (8) Social Justice Scholarship and Thought
- a second evolution of these postmodern ideas

** (9) Social Justice and Action
** (10) An Alternative to the Ideology of Social Justice
** Comments
*** On Psychology
- the obsession with "power dynamics in every interaction, utterance and
  cultural grievances"
  - transferance?
  - paranoia in individuals often arises when the individual, for
    whatever reason, lacks the understanding/means/balance to control
    aspects of their lives around them.
    - hmmmm... this is similar in a way, but not at all like paranoia
      (there can be social paranoia for sure) .... or is it a group
      manifestation of paranoia?
- transferance/countertransferance
  - jungian psychoanalysis
  - conditioning people to react to triggers
- solutions to issues of social justice may not be found by focusing on
  the problems
  - if people seek to mischaracterize others or unintentionally sow the
    seeds of enmity.... then people become marginlized or alienated.
    they gradually drift away from others. afterwards they have fewer
    opportunities to address sources of misunderstanding.

*** Progressive issues usually advance when there other needs of society have been met
**** is it possible to turn their language games upside down?
- i would describe myself as woke, but

*** On Factionalization
- thinking about the problem of factionalization in terms of
  "attractive/repulsive" forces in society‚Äù
  - to overcome misunderstanding between people or the factionalization
    of various groups, the forces that pull us together need to be
    stronger than what might otherwise push us apart
  - in relationships and groups, if there aren't sufficient variety of
    forces that pull people together, those groups will drift apart,
    become fragmented or, in the extreme, become alienated from each
    other
