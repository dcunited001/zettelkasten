#+title: Guix configure wacom tablet

+ [[id:b82627bf-a0de-45c5-8ff4-229936549942][Guix]]

+ guix has =libwacom= and =xf86-input-wacom=, but no =input-wacom= package
  - fortunately, =input-wacom= package [[https://github.com/linuxwacom/input-wacom/wiki/Installing-input-wacom-from-source][should be simple]]
  - however =modinfo wacom= shows that guix includes wacom driver module

** Determine whether module is included

Test to see if wacom is loaded: =lsmod | grep wacom=

Show wacom module details: =modinfo wacom=

* Update Guix System

** Add packages

Ensure =(gnu packages xdisorg)= is loaded and add these packages to desktop:

+ xf86-input-wacom
+ libwacom
