** Emacs Config

*** init.el

Loads =preload.el= (if file exists)

Then loads =bootstrap.el= and =packages.el=

**** bootstrap.el



**** packages.el

In order top/bottom, left/right.

| counsel-projectile |               |                |                 |

Then the first batch of scimax packages, with a few others as needed.

| Package         |                   |
|-----------------+-------------------|
| scimax          | scimax-email      |
| scimax-mode     | scimax-projectile |
| scimax-org      | scimax-spellcheck |
| ox-clip         | scimax-utils      |
| scimax-contacts | bibtex-hotkeys    |

Loads =scimax-notebook.org=

| Package       |                          |
|---------------+--------------------------|
| ox-manuscript | scimax-autoformat-abbrev |
| org-show      | scimax-hydra             |
| words         | scimax-journal           |
| ore           | scimax-apps              |
| scimax-ivy    | scimax-ob                |
| scimax-yas    |                          |

Loads =scimax-editmarks.org=

Finally, =packages.el= adds =scimax-dir= to the =Info-directory-list=.

***** scimax-notebook.org

This builds on top of =projectile= to set up a project workflow.




This loads a few more packages.

| Package            |          |
|--------------------+----------|
| ggtags             | org-ql   |
| ibuffer-projectile | ivy-xref |
| ag                 |          |

***** scimax-editmarks.org

This contains a lot of interesting code snippets
and ideas, mostly for supporting =editmarks= in the =sem-mode=. This mode
facilitates academic collaboration, but also serves as another good intro to
emacs-lisp.

The file also introduces =font-lock= and demonstrates building Emacs menus,
which is a seriously underrated Emacs feature, esp. for noobs.

*** scimax.el

+ sets up =org-level-n= which fixes the annoying need to remove spaces in the
  emacs-lisp outline comments that lispy can navigate (I think?). yay... I had
  tried to figure this out at one point, but got too deep in emacs
  archeology. once I realized that outline-mode is the ancestor of org-mode, I
  noped the fuck out. it also sets this up in python.
+ sets up a hydra for navigation, covering most of the avy functions. generally
  covers all the emacs functions (and how to set up a hydra)
+ begins to cover how to create some basic emacs text manipulation functions and
  works up to writing a minor mode.

**** scimax-mode.el




** emacs-jupyter

*** Environment

**** Python/Jupyter

**** Emacs/Org
