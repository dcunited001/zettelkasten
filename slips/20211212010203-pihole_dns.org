* Notes

** Process
*** Prepare CentOS
- Download "boot" image
- Boot and setup networking
  - For pihole, a static IP is needed (obviously)
  - once network is configured, the boot image will begin downloading packages
- select minimal install
  - standard
  - containers
  - rpm dev
  - development tools
  - headless
  - security
  - smart card
  - system tools
- Configure users
  - set root password
  - create a non-root user
- (for me) simply use the single-disk option
  - ensure LUKS is active
    - TODO find out of this is luks or luks2?

*** Configure Centos
**** TODO rehash TPM setup instructions?
- =yum -y install tpm-tools= for tpm1.2
- test start =systemctl start tcsd=
- then enable
- clear the TPM
- use the tools to provision the TPM for CentOS, ensure a keystore? is setup
- modify initramfs (grub is not being used on this installation)
  - initramfs needs to query the TPM chip/module for the LUKS password
  - this initramfs needs to be rebuilt
  - system needs to be modified to setup initramfs rebuilds to include this config


**** Config hostname and resov.conf
- After install, change the DNS from =94.140.14.14=
  - Note, i also changed =IPV6INIT=no= to deny ip6
  - This is because my firewall rules don't block it.
- Delete the DNS from =/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno1=
  - [[https://serverok.in/centos-7-resolv-conf-permanent][this page]] explains why
  - then add it to =/etc/resolv.conf=
  - probably reboot or restart services

*** Permissify SELinux
See [[https://jenglishio.wordpress.com/2020/11/20/how-to-install-pi-hole-on-centos-8-with-selinux/][this guide]] (and probably others)

- edit =/etc/selinux/config= and set =SELINUX_=permissive=
- =reboot=
- set firewall rules
- when installation is complete, undo

** Pi-Hole

Note, on my ethernet card, ip6 is not configured...

*** Install

- After install, add user to =pihole= group
- If the hostname was not configured in the centos install menu (network)
  - then set =/etc/hostname= and =/etc/hosts= before the pi install
  - when these are changed the pihole services need to be restarted

**** TODO Lets Encrypt + Traefik to set up HTTPS on PiHole

*** Configure Firewall
