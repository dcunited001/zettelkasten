** Can't mount a USB device to a running VM in proxmox

connect via ssh

#+begin_src shell
lsusb # -v
usbid=abcd:1234
usbport=usb3
vmid=1234
qm set $vmid $usbport host=$usbid
#+end_src

i'm kinda bummed that there's a 5-device limit unless you pass everything
through ..... that means no usb-hubs as passthrough. i don't care really, but i
my proxmox node has overcomplicated everything to the point where the
inefficiencys i have barely outweigh the benefits (like 100+ gigs of
ready-to-run forensics/hacking VM's i haven't been able to use yet)
