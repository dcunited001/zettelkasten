#+begin_quote
and in fact if you have a surface with its normal versors orthogonal to it, the
flux does a scalar product against these versors so it takes account of how much
of the vector field is orthogonal to the surface (parallel to the orthogonal
versor)

If:

+ If
$cos^{2}\theta + sin^{2}\theta = 1$ represents a circle
  - and $cosh^{2}\theta - sinh^{2}\theta = 1$ represents (a continuation of a circle? into) a hyperbola (i.e. $cosh^{2}\theta - sinh^{2}\theta = cos^{2}\theta + sin^{2}\theta)$ ?)
+ and if versors satisfy a similar distance equivalence over the surface of a
    sphere -- which involves $exp(ar) = cos^{2}\theta + r*sin^{2}\theta$ where r is a vector quaternion and $r^{2} = -1$

Then =Circle :: Hyperbola :: ...What?==
