#+TITLE: Leadership: Managerial Skills for Interpersonal Dynamics
#+CATEGORY: slips
#+TAGS:

* Resources

* Notes

The few lectures that I've watched in this NPTEL course opened me up to new
abstractions/systems for building relationships.

** ICA and IO

** FIRO

Here, interpersonal relations has been expanded to include all levels of human
organization: individuals, couples, groups, localities, organizations, nations.

*** FIRO B: a measure of behaviors.

+ This form of FIRO focuses on how an individual /behaves/ in interpersonal
  situations, rather than how he/she feels.
+ Expressed Behavior :: The extent to which you prefer to initiate a
  behavior. Your comfort level when engaging in such behaviors is assoc. with
   "need areas" (see ICA)
+ Wanted Behavior :: The level of behavior that you would like to receive from
  others. Wanted behaviores are not implicitly visibile/known and thus people
  form assumptions about what is wanted based on is expressed -- or what they
  perceive as expressed (and why) ... which is subject to distortion.

|-----------+-----------+--------|
| FIRO B    | Expressed | Wanted |
|-----------+-----------+--------|
| Inclusion |           |        |
| Control   |           |        |
| Affection |           |        |
|-----------+-----------+--------|

*** FIRO F: a measure of feelings

|--------------+-----------+--------|
| FIRO F       | Expressed | Wanted |
|--------------+-----------+--------|
| Significance |           |        |
| Competence   |           |        |
| Likeabilit   |           |        |
|--------------+-----------+--------|

* Handwritten Notes

Yeh I don't have time to fully type this out.

#+begin_quote
One reason I'm so pissed about everything is because /now/ I understand
everything in content like this ... but I never have enough social exposure to
practice it, so other people's perceptions and imposed constraints totally
define my life, which is exactly what restricts me from social access.

Tarot and I Ching would also be useful ... but almost all the concepts require
some experience of social interactions to unpack. Most of the Tarot cards are
meaningful like the definitions of words in a dictionary might convey meaning,
but I have basically recent zero memories experiencing these things.

So yeh, when you work on this stuff by watching lectures and you're capable of
combining ideas other people believe to be "liberal arts" with vector calculus,
tensors and statistics, then ... yeh you might be a little pissed off about it.

For example, the "ICA" tetrahedron in the notes below was an attempt to imagine
the ICA triad in terms of an analogue of the subjective logic triangle. I
couldn't really figure out how to make this multinomial if each value in the
"ICA triad" would be on a continuum -- i.e. if some point on the surface would
correspond to (I,C,A) then extending into a common uncertainty.

Regardless, the point is to provide yourself with an abstraction that provides
for uncertainty/change in where you would place someone (or their recent
behavior/tendencies).

Notes. Probably looks crazy ... but the total absence of some model that
fulfills the same role as these models is like precisely what makes people
crazy/unhappy. So I really couldn't care less.

When I say "people don't understand social things, social mechanics, etc", i'm
basically saying they have no basis for reasoning about much of these
concepts. Consumerism, technology and modern society keep people
subservient/dependent/angsty by robbing them of this knowledge or misconstruing
healthy behavior as toxic/sociopathic/narcissistic, etc. In its place, people
are bombarded by messages from advertising or government authorities, telling
them that if they buy X or agree with Y or dissociate with person Z, then
somehow leads them to happiness.. Really, people need to develop and
understanding of social mechanics ... however they do that, there are a hundred
ways.
