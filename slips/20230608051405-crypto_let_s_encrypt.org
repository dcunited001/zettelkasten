** Domain Delegation

OMFG it takes forever to find clear answers on some subjects without bounding
your search queries to specific domains. Like FOREVER long. Like 5 hours.

[[Cert for domain with only internal / delegated DNS][Cert for domain with only internal/delegated DNS]] (2023)

You can create DNS TXT records on the Root DNS server for the delegated
subdomain ... because DNS is tiered and servers facilitate consensus... Dammit.

#+begin_quote
What happens if you have conflicting values for a TXT record here? Particularly
where the server on NS record uses a faster update time and clients have cached
lookups to that subdomain as depending on the delegated domain?

It also seems important to guard against if delegating while using "split brain"
DNS (or perhaps in a situation where considering split-brain).

Clear answer on delegated subdomains.

#+begin_quote
*Q:* is there a way to simply delegate all requests for a domain to a subdomain without needing a CNAME for every single required fqdn?

*A:* Name reduction only happens when you can group similar names within a single wildcard.
Then you can CNAME the _acme-challenge entry required for that wildcard (and all others) to any other FQDN.
Otherwise, you will likely need one-for-one CNAME entries for each name requiring a cert.
[some can be grouped in DNS with the "*" - but that usually fails for root folder domain entries]

[[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/dns/deploy/dns-sb-with-ad][Split-Brain DNS]]: sounds delightful; no idea what it is. The link is for the
implementation on AD, but I really hope I don't have to use this simply because
I'm poor ...

... okay it sounds like maybe I do, but that a proper VPN & routing
configuration would probably work except in sensitive networks where you don't
want Bourgeois Bob to leak information about subnet structure simply because he
doesn't know how to configure the coffee shop WiFi. I'm not 100% sure how to
solve that problem yet, but I don't actually have /those/ problems.

See: [[https://newdiscourses.com/2021/05/bourgeois-overproduction-problem-fake-elite/][Bourgeois Overproduction and the Problem of the Fake Elite]] to understand
the reference ... which may just end up in a self-own, now that I recall what
/ressentiment/ means.

** Wildcard certificates

*** Technicalities

These are some of the little "technicalities" I'd like to avoid that inviolates
whatever you planned for your DNS ... where maybe your feedback loop is long or
error messages are vague.

+ Certificates must be validated by DNS-01

Let's Encrypt does not include a warranty (no guarantee to cover losses), nor
does it offer a "Trust Seal" which are apparently easy to spoof.

*** Common Mistaktes

+ Not placing the intermediate certs for full chain of trust on the
  server. Results in browser/client-specific issues
+ Not protecting your key file: you'll be transmitting this to (or from or via)
  wherever the ACME interaction with Let's Encrypt occurs generated

**** Options for protecting key file (not really in video):

+ Delayed response to ACME: transport the data manually to/from the public
  server (problems with delyaing responses?)
+ SSH Forwarding: set up the server to expect an SSH connection and forward the
  relevant traffic to Let's Encrypt.
+ GPG Forwarding (with yubikey): forward encrypted data to the server

If you create a file on the server, you want to destroy the server image. The
certs could (in theory!) be recovered from filesystems that use
snapshots. Sounds overboard, but it's best to keep some secrets in-memory or
off-network. Then, from the wildcard certificate, you can generate certs from
(and for) intermediate CA's and just use these ... unless I'm missing
something...

Oh, shit I am.

*** Misc

+ DNS CAA records :: list Root CA's for which certs are issued

Configuration

+ Cert chains, protocol & cipher suite limitation

Performance

+ Session resumption
+ Content caching, OCSP Stabling

  HTTP/App Security

+ Secure Compression (no HTTPS compression)
+ Secure cookies
+ HSTS settings
