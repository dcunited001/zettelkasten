**** TODO add filetags (video notes)

* Overview

** Concepts

** Process

+ evaluate STM32 chip on (software)
  - here you can play around with pinout configurations

*** Start the Eeschema schematic

+ Labels & Nets
  - Global labels allow you to chop the schematic into parts

*** Decoupling Capacitors
+ One decoupling capacitor per =VDD= and =VBAT=. Here 100uf.
  - plus one large decoupling cap closest to the chip

**** TODO what is the purpose of these capacitors
+ and the others

*** MP2359DJ
+ see data sheet (or pdf that contains formulas)

* Goals

+ Overview of design process beginning to end
+ Schematics in KiCad
+ Basic AC Circuit analysis/testing

* Notes

** STM32... Chip

*** Oscillator

+ 16 Mhz
+ Connects to =PH0(HSE_IN)= and =PH1(HSE_OUT)=
  - R3 Feed Resistor :: limits the output(?) of the oscillator, preventing some harmonics from emerging
+ Contains a crystal oscillator (?), but using an external component results in better quality (?)
  - 30:20 :: Look at the STM32 oscillator design guide
+ Need to calculate load capacitance of the oscillator net(?).
  - Look at the ()data sheet) and use the formula:

$C_{Load}=2*(C_L - C_{Stray})$

** Pins
+ NRST :: controls reset of chip
+ BOOT0 :: controls program state or enables debugging

** Parts
+ Capacitor ESR ::
  - low ESR caps are needed to connect to =V_1= and =V_2=
**** TODO why are these low ESR

** Conventions/etc

+ try to avoid 4-terminal junctions
