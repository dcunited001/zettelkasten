* Resources
+ Python [[https://pypi.org/project/extcolors/][extcolors]]
+ [[https://michaellynnadams.com/color-chart-exercise-for-oil-paints/][Richard Schmid Color Charts]] from Michelle Lynn Adams
+ Using venv in org-babel ([[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/2416][doomemacs issue 2416]]) or just use =jupyter.el=

* Notes

Set =:kernel emacs-ipykernel= to use another kernel ... or run on the network
for bonus points.

** Finding python

#+begin_src jupyter-python
!pyenv which python
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /my/lang/.pyenv/versions/3.12.1/bin/python

#+begin_src jupyter-python
!pwd
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /this/dir

* Palettes

All the images of palettes were sourced from Michelle Lynn Adams' blog on [[https://michaellynnadams.com/color-chart-exercise-for-oil-paints/][Richard
Schmid Color Charts]].

** As An Image

The palette as an image

#+begin_src jupyter-python
!extcolors "img/art/palettes/_basic.jpg" --image "img/art/palettes/_basic-palette" --silence --tolerance 10
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

For now, it's not too useful to an artist, since you can't easily tell which
colors are duplicated or which belong to each pigment. To intelligently sort the
colors in the palette it's going to need a bit of python or manual
cropping/labelling. The gimp pallets would need to be concatenated and/or
organized. Honestly, it's easier to just use images for digital painting
palettes.

** As a GIMP Palette

A gimp palette to import as a Krita resource

#+begin_src jupyter-python
!extcolors "img/art/palettes/_basic.jpg" --gpl "img/art/palettes/_basic" --silence --tolerance 10
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
