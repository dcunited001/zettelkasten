* Basics

Most of this info is in Proxmox Docs =10.9=

** Setup Network

**** TODO update the following
+ configure =vmbrX= virtual bridges
  - configure trunking where necessary

** Setup Apt

+ Add downloads.proxmox.com to apt sources
+ Update firewall to allow fetching from apt sources
+ Run =netselect-apt= to select a set of mirrors
  - Check the mirror selection in =/etc/apt/sources.list=
+ Run =apt-get update=

** Setup Passthrough
*** Blacklist modules
=echo blacklist amdgpu >> /etc/


*** Ensure BIOS Configured
+ IOMMU, SRV-IO (?) and other options need to be turned on. Don't boot with the AMD GPU.
+ For some games, AMD GPU resize bar and other options are needed


*** Ensure modules are loaded

=lsmod | grep vfio= should indicate:

#+begin_quote
vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_pci
vfio_virqfd
#+end_quote

If they're lacking, add them to =/etc/modules=

Run =update-initramfs -u -k all= to update modules/grub config

*** Update Linux params in Grub

Open =/etc/default/grub= and set =GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=

+ For AMD CPU's, the =amd_iommu= feature will automatically be turned on if AMD-Vi
  is detected.
+ Setting full device passthrough with =iommu=pt= will help address
  performance issues and may be needed for gaming.
  - Full passthrough allows DMA
    which apps may need for consistency -- otherwise memory race-conditions or wierd
    things will happen.
  - Resize BAR (enabling GPU to access more than 4G of CPU RAM) may require
