#+TITLE: Home Hazards: Health Effects From Environmental Issues
#+CATEGORY: slips
#+TAGS:

TL;DR; Basements are full of environmental dynamics/hazards that are terrible
for your mental and physical health. I could list like 12 separate things that
could be a problem, but there are some that are worse than others.

#+begin_quote
Again, to be clear, I'm just documenting this as is. I don't want to blame
anyone because things like this just happen. However, /why/ something happens
doesn't matter nearly as much as /what/ happens and /how/ you deal with it. I
would love to be wrong here.
#+end_quote

For me, I mainly just need to eliminate variables that aren't actually a
problem. Once I cross it off the list or have tools to determine whether it's an
issue, then I can move on. Unfortunately, I make almost zero money and spend
almost 100% of my time in the basement.

I don't understand most of this myself, but what I do understand is that, when I
leave my house, I start to feel quite a bit better. However, I'm pretty
confident that environmental hazards like this end up resulting in significant
downstream medical costs, but worse they complicate diagnosis and treatment.

Knowing that almost no doctor except a functional doctor would pursue
investigating environmental issues is a bit frustrating. To be fair, it would
basically be an endless cycle of "what if it's this?" that yield inconclusive
results. However, when environmental issues realllly are a problem, fixing them
prevents other downstream medical issues from getting worse. Furthermore, if you
eliminate possible environmental variables that are a concern, it clears up
other issues to be more adequately tested/diagnosed. Now that I finally have
medicaid... I can finally get lab tests and things like this done.

* Resources

** Toxicology

I've considered getting a toxicology textbook, but the cheaper one's that I've
seen are not so great. The only reference I have is [[https://www.amazon.com/Dreisbachs-HANDBOOK-POISONING-Prevention-Diagnosis/dp/1850700389][Dreisbach's Handbook of
Poisoining]] (1983 11th Ed.) -- $2 at Goodwill.  I was able to look up
information on =deltamethrin= -- a crystallized insoluble formulation of an
insecticide that was used in my workshop area. It's along the lines of what I'm
looking for, at least as a reference that covers many problematic chemical
families.

Between a textbook and various references, ideally, I'd have some comprehensive
quick-access references that:

+ specify how various chemical families cause cascading effects in specific
  organ systems
+ include information about safe exposure levels and precautions
+ include information about response to poison exposures, potentially including
  some case history

Toxicology is extremely useful in learning more about how organ systems are
supposed to work together, since you can know what is driving the changes and
have more confidence over the timeline. I'm more interested in using it for that
than to double check every chemical in my house.

** OSHA and Safety

Another source that covers quite a bit of ground are OSHA manuals/docs:

+ [[https://www.osha.gov/otm/table-of-contents][OSHA Instruction TED]]
+ OSHA [[https://www.osha.gov/topics/general-references/reference-texts][suggested reference texts]]
+ OSHA [[https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber][Regulations (Standards 29 CFR)]]
+ OSHA publications as PDF: [[https://www.osha.gov/publications/all][All]] and [[https://www.osha.gov/publications/bytype/popular-downloads][Popular]]
+ CDC [[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/][Occupational Health Guidelines for Chemical Hazards]]
+ And I believe [[https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910][Part 1910 of 29 CFR]] was what our instructor had in class. This
  is the most general set of regulations in plain legalese.

These documents detail the regulations detail precaution, detection, rationale,
response, first aid & medical, and legal. In some cases, it attaches dollar
amount, which in addition to other factors like number of conditions/controls or
number of words, can be used somewhat to develop a sense of proportion w.r.t. an
otherwise very complex interactions/effects.

It's probably more information than you're looking for, but filling in a large
set of sparse points helps you understand the overall structure of the space so
that interpolation is more accurate.

* Coolant Leaks

** Why this?

Sometime around 2016 or 2017, I started suspecting this after googling the kind
of "shortness of breath" that resembles respiratory acidosis. Normally, your
brainstem slows your breathing in response to alkylosis. In practice this occurs
for various reason. However, when it involves a coolant then either its physical
properties or a chemical/biological response it induces slows your breathing.
This is outside the scope of what your brainstem tries to regulate as a Control
System for pH and introduces an external affect on the control system feedback
loop. Your breathing is slowed so acidity increases. It's not clear how this
unfolds in the body afterwards. Your brainstem should try to increase the rate
of breathing, but when I experience this (from whatever cause), that's not what
happens. Downstream, my urine seems to become more acidic (i've measured it
though not recently) and thus I piss out my adderall. Then I get tired.

One thing that came up is refrigerant exposure. I spend a ton of time in the
basement and I sleep /somewhat/ close to the AC unit. I don't think it's been
much of a problem, but this seems like a larger leak.

Increasing carbonic acid in your bloodstream is a short time-scale mechanism for
regulating blood pH that doesn't involve more expensive methods like:

+ metabolic regulation via the kidneys & elsewhere
+ drawing on stores of minerals like the calcium in your bones

Theoretically, these can introduce imbalances in mineral concentrations.

*** Acid/Base Diets are Bunk?

When a doctor tells you that the "acid/base diet" is bunk because the blood's pH
is buffered, maybe consider browbeating them. Most online information about this
is bullshit (but maybe not the worst natural medical advice), but there are
other sides to the "buffered pH" equation. There's evidence that fluoridated
water extracts calcium from bones and combining this with the much more
problematic mechanism of calcium extraction via phosphoric acid in sodas -- well
I think we can cancel that "walk for osteoperosis research" because it's fucking
obvious.

** Cleanup?

It was bubbling after I turned off the AC at the thermostat. Coolant works
because its phase changes along with heat capacity allow it to carry heat away
from a temperature gradient. This depends on properties downstream from its
density in gas form at STP. To be transported, it needs compression & pressure
to change phase. Without the pressure, it should turn into a gas, which is
responsible for the hissing. When you hear it bubbling... that's a problem. It
doesn't correspond to the severity of the leak (there's definitely a leak), but
lots of fluid has to shuffle around to reach a new equilibrium.

If you make less than $3,000 and every if neanderthal makes insinuations about
your mental health when you're concerned about environmental factors, then I
guess you're own your own. Yeh, I don't want to be down here "tryharding" and
simply exposing myself to various toxic factors /in almost linear proportion to
the amount of time I spend at a computer./

*** Handle Excess Fluid Buildup From Large Release

The following method is just kinda stupid. It might work. It probably
won't. It's impossible to know with zero experience.

Depending on the failure modes for AC Compressors and fluid lines, it may not
even be necessary since $| \Delta T |$ is almost always greater for the outside
unit. When it's hot, the frozen sections in the outdoor unit will melt first and
will typically experience larger ice accumulation. The failures will usually be
larger here, which means the gas will usually have a better path for relief
here. With zero experience, I can't really be sure how often this is the case,
but it certainly seems like a good idea for safety to lean on this. Other areas
can deal with change in size/shape/etc from ice build-up, pressure and blockage,
which is likely somehow responsible for the hissing.

Anyways, I carried a shopvac outside, emptied a hose of most of the water and
used gorilla tape to create an airtight seal.

#+begin_quote
Fun fact: I ensured that change in shape in the hose created a $\delta h$ over
in time with a monotonic differential to carry the maximum amount of water
out. Probably mincing words there.
#+end_quote

Monotonic wut? LOL fucking crazy!

Anyways, so then I flattened out the hose to minimize the curvature and $\delta
h$ along its length while eliminating kinks. These can also be considered in
terms of monotonic functions -- not necessary, but it helps you intuit things to
optimize or minimize effects, without having to remember specific details. The
trouble is determining what the relative scale of effects are to determine which
"features" are worth the effort to optimize.

The hose is run to the AC closet and sitting on the floor. It has adequate
suction, but there's a circuit of airflow which includes at least the door, a
laundry chute, the AC intake/outflow and the hose/vacuum rig.

Issues with this approach:

+ You can't know how long or how often to run the vac to ensure sufficient
  coolant has been expelled. Not without calculations or experience or feedback
  from a refrigerant detector.
+ You may unintentionally increase your exposure or cause an acute exposure
  event. No coronavirus mask will block of gas.
+ For the last few days having a Google Cloud trial fully loaded with $400 and
  an active Coursera Account ... it's probably smarter to stay away from your
  computers until someone with experience takes a look.

**** On Monotonicity

For energy potentials (esp in pipes/hoses), you're generally looking for
monotonicity if you want to maximize flow/power/efficiency. Number of diameter
changes: minimizes turbulance. Number of lateral directional changes: minimizes
impact of turbulent flows. Number of ups/downs, minimizes inefficiencies in
fluid flow. And on and on. Almost all leaks, corrosion or degradation will
correlate strongly with anything that deviates from ideal
monotonicity. Corrosion will accumulate wherever it begins, especially if it
changes the crystal/inter-grain structure of metals -- this strongly distorts
changes in shape/size that rapidly accelerate local turbulence and flux of
problematic chemicals.

Oh and I forgot about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation][cavitation]] -- see [[https://fluids.umn.edu/research/bubbly-and-cavitation-flows][Cavitation Flows]] simulation. If
cavitation increases the local oxygenation, it accelerates redox reactions that
corrode metal in addition to damage from any shockwaves.

* Steam Heating

If you have steam heating with a device that has an "iron body circulator" where
it's been loosened, it is absolutely possible for the steam pipes in your house
to resonate at the "fear frequency" ... and that shit is real. It is absolutely
real.

Oh and if I had to guess on the phenomena of UFO sightings by pilots, whether
military or civilian, then I would guess ... Fear frequency. That shit is
real. It's impossible to totally eliminate high-magnitude, low-frequency noise
vibrations in some parts of an aircraft.

You really need to be alone and unaware of the infrasonic sound to experience
the effects. They generally just stimulate fight/flight response, but also tends
to create the sensation that there's someone or something else there. Infrasonic
sounds are associated with haunted places. They can lead to artifacts in your
peripheral vision, which I experienced /once or twice/ as dark fleeting images
in the corner of my eye.

This wasn't nearly as much of a problem as the random and consistent stimulation
of the amygdala when the heat came on. The effect on your mood & mind is related
to how unconscious you are to it, since you can harden against it if you expect
it.

I noticed the reverberation because the pipes were mounted near materials
connected to the glass windows, which produced sounds with low and high
frequencies indoors that disappeared when I went outside. All sounds taper off
at a square of the distance, but infrasonic sounds wrap around sufficiently
large objects whereas high-frequency sounds /always/ reflect and are easier to
locate. I felt the pipes and they resonated. I traced it to the source and
stopped it. I have experienced none of the effects since.

** Seasonal Affective Disorder

I feel like this is just one rare, but potential cause of "Seasonal Affective
Disorder" -- which /laughably is in the DSM./ It is not a disorder. It is a
collection of causes creating downstream effects that merely /correlate with/
seasonal changes: vitamin D insufficiency, social withdrawal in cold weather,
exposure to effects/chemicals related to heating and cooling, etc. When you
bundle everything together under a fictitious diagnosis, all the data that's
categorized using with ICD codes can become intractibly inseparable, unless
there's a way to untangle it later. For many disease labels that are really
bundles of individual pathologies, then you must realllly be skeptical of any
metanalysis. Whether the metanalysis counts:

+ all the data under a single label :: the data loses it's granularity and is
  difficult to properly aggregate.
+ studies where it's not properly labeled :: similar to the above, but you
  really can't trust it.
+ drops data sources that aren't properly labeled :: well is this a fair
  sampling of study data
+ attempts to retroactively construct subtypes :: it's tough to explain how this
  data isn't subject to various levels of bias for each method of comporting
  data across studies

More effort is needed to properly label data according to their /actual
pathology/ or to at least annotate it so larger studies/metanalyses can
confidently collate across data sets. Otherwise, the "authoritative" but lazy
approaches of metanalyses will exhibit impact according to the study size --
/CREATING FALSE "KNOWLEDGE."/

Often these metanalyses should work, but various factors really limit science's
ability to accumulate an authoritative body of knowledge in medicine:

+ the privacy policies in place on data
+ intrinsic problems with data labelling
+ bureaucratic control over disease labels (DSM -2.0)
+ collating data collected by smart devices with distinct-yet-inferior controls
  on data accuracy.

* Flame Retardants

There is a dust in my house for which I cannot find the source. It's mainly
contained to the basement, as is like 90% of the dust. Most of this is probably
generated by the dryer.

Regardless, some large component of the dust:

+ glows purplish blue under UV light
+ doesn't react with literally anything
+ is not affected whatsoever by the heat of a butane lighter.

This is probably nothing.

* Mold

** Recycling Spores in the Refridgerator

I don't think mold is an issue, but there is a clear difference in the time
required for vegetables to expire if they are kept in the downstairs
refrigerator. This depends on difference between the purchase date and the to
expiration date. None of the mold is particularly alarming, but fairly
benign. What is weird is how much faster it spoils.

This insight almost seems like a litmus, but it's especially clear for organics.
Some organic food, esp broccolli or vegetables that mold, will go bad in 3 days
or less. I suspect this might have something to do with the airflow between the
refridgerator and the freezer, since it's basically one connected compartment
with ventilation. This would cause the freezer to act as a reservoir for spores
and accelerate new growths -- if this is correct, then it's not a great litmus
at all. The freezer requires more work to clean, but the ventilation would be
very difficult.

#+begin_quote
This sucks because if you have mild depression that's helped by foods like
broccoli, but don't necessarily crave the foods, it's just a pain in the ass.

Also, all the fucking grocery stores are still closed at night because the new
normal is "you have to pay us to deliver groceries."
#+end_quote

When splitting the bag and putting half upstairs without exposure, there is a
clear difference in the time require for the food to spoil in one fridge versus
another -- this is about 2.0x to 2.5x for the upstairs fridge. I noticed this
after splitting the vegetables, since I don't always want to walk upstairs to
get the food. First world problems, am I right?
