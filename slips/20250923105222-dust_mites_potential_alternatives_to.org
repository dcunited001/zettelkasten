north american "parasite worms" black
#+end_quote

*** A1

#+begin_quote
In North America, the term "parasite worms" that are black in color can refer to
several different species, most notably the horsehair worm and the invasive New
Guinea flatworm . Other, less common black or dark-colored worms are sometimes
misidentified as parasitic. Horsehair worms (Nematomorpha) These are long, thin,
parasitic worms that emerge from insect hosts into aquatic environments.

Appearance: They look like long, thin, black or brownish threads, growing up
to a foot or more in length. When multiple worms are entwined, they resemble
a Gordian knot. Life cycle: The larvae are parasites of various insects,
such as grasshoppers and crickets. They develop inside the host and emerge
as free-living adults when the insect is near water. Threat to humans and
pets: Horsehair worms do not parasitize humans or domestic animals. The
common name comes from their resemblance to a horse's hair and their
occasional presence in water troughs.

New Guinea flatworm (Platydemus manokwari)

This is a highly invasive and toxic predatory flatworm, not a true parasitic
worm.

Appearance: This species is shiny, dark brown or black, with a paler stripe
running down its back. It is flat and can measure between 1.5 and 2.6 inches
long. Origin and habitat: Native to New Guinea, this species was
accidentally introduced to North America and has been sighted in Florida,
Texas, and Louisiana. It lives in moist, dark places, including gardens,
potted plants, and under rocks. Threat to humans and pets: The New Guinea
flatworm can carry the rat lungworm parasite, which can be transmitted to
humans if the worm is ingested, though human infection is rare. The worms
also secrete a toxic, caustic substance that can cause skin irritation. It
is best to avoid touching them and use gloves for removal.

Other potential dark "parasite worms"

Raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis)

Though not typically described as black, this roundworm is common in raccoons
across North America.

Appearance: The adult worm itself is robust and light-colored. However, the
worm's eggs are spread through raccoon feces, which are typically dark and
found in communal "latrines". Threat to humans: Human infection can occur if
the eggs are accidentally ingested. While rare, it can lead to severe and
sometimes fatal neurological disease. Prevention: The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) advises exercising caution when cleaning areas
contaminated with raccoon feces.

Millipedes

People sometimes mistake millipedes for worms.

Appearance: Some millipede species found in North America can be black or
dark-colored. Threat: These are not parasitic and pose no threat to humans
or pets. They are detritivores, meaning they feed on decaying organic
matter.

Drainage worms

The larvae of certain flies, such as drain flies, can appear as small, dark worms in drains.

Appearance: These worms are small and dark and are often found in wet,
decomposing organic matter, such as that found in a kitchen sink drain.
Threat: While not parasitic, they can spread bacteria from their
environment.

Disclaimer: If you suspect a parasitic infection in yourself or your pet, you should consult a medical or veterinary professional. If you find an unusual worm, do not handle it with your bare hands.

#+begin_quote
What kind of parasites in north america infect skin, are potentially associated with scabies, are up to 1mm long and are less than 15um wide
#+end_quote

*** A2

#+begin_quote
The specific parasite that causes scabies and fits the given dimensions is the
human itch mite, Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. It is important to note that
the dimensions you provided—up to 1mm long and less than 15µm wide—do not match
the scabies mite. The parasite's actual dimensions are different, though still
microscopic. Here is a more accurate description of the mite based on the
information retrieved:

Name: Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis.

Dimensions: An adult female is typically 0.30–0.45 mm long and 0.25–0.35 mm wide. The males are smaller, measuring 0.20–0.24 mm by 0.15–0.20 mm.

Life cycle and characteristics:

The female mite burrows into the outer layer of the skin (stratum
corneum), where it lays two to three eggs per day. It takes
approximately 10 to 14 days for the eggs to hatch and develop into adult
mites. The intense itching associated with scabies is an allergic
reaction to the proteins and feces of the mites.

Other potential skin parasites: While your dimensions are likely incorrect for the scabies mite, they are also too narrow for other skin parasites found in North America. For example, follicle mites (Demodex spp.), another type of skin-dwelling mite, are typically 0.30 mm long by 0.05 mm wide and are not directly associated with scabies.

Important medical notice:

If you suspect you have a parasitic skin infection like scabies, do not rely on
self-diagnosis based on dimensions. It is crucial to consult a healthcare
provider or a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. This

** Q3

#+begin_quote
What kind of parasites in north america infect skin and have black worm-like
larva that are up to 0.5mm long while being less than 15um wide
#+end_quote

*** A3

#+begin_quote
No skin-infecting parasite in North America is known to produce black, worm-like
larvae with the specific dimensions of up to 0.5 mm long and less than 15 µm
wide

The description likely refers to different phenomena or misidentifications
rather than a single parasitic species.

Here are some potential explanations for what a person might be observing:

Cutaneous larva migrans (hookworm larvae)

These are a likely cause of skin infections from worm-like larvae in North America, but their color and size are different.

Appearance: These larvae are too small to be seen clearly without
magnification. The visible effect is a "creeping eruption"—a red, intensely
itchy, and winding rash on the skin. The tracks are caused by the larvae
migrating just under the skin's surface.

Dimensions: The hookworm larvae (Ancylostoma spp.) that cause this condition
are microscopic.

Color: The larvae themselves are not black. The visible signs on the skin
are inflammatory tracks, which are red or reddish-brown.

Origin: The larvae, which are passed in the feces of infected animals like
dogs and cats, are found in warm, moist soil or sand.


Filarial worms
Some filarial worms, including the eye worm Loa loa, are found in certain parts of the world, but cases in North America are almost always related to travel.

Appearance: Loa loa adults have a length of 30–70 mm and a diameter of
0.35–0.5 mm. The larvae (microfilariae) are much smaller and are often only
6–8 µm wide.

Color: Neither the adult worm nor its larvae are described as black.

Artifacts and non-parasitic conditions
Some non-parasitic phenomena can also be misidentified as black, worm-like organisms.

Splinters or plant matter: Small, dark fibers or slivers of plant material
can become embedded in the skin and resemble a moving object as the
surrounding tissue changes.

Dirt or other debris: Small, dark pieces of debris can get into skin pores
or minor abrasions and be mistaken for a parasite.

Pili migrans: This is a rare, harmless condition where a hair shaft becomes
embedded under the skin. It can cause an itchy, linear track that mimics a
migrating parasite.

Dermatophyte fungus: Some fungal infections can cause linear or expanding
skin lesions, though they are not caused by worms.

Important medical notice

If you have a skin condition that you suspect is caused by a parasite, consult a
healthcare provider or a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment.

incorrect treatments. This is for informational purposes only. For medical

#+begin_quote
Morgellons disease, also known as delusional infestation. It is a controversial condition characterized by a strong belief that fibers or other material are emerging from skin sores. The fibers are often described as black, white, blue, or red. The condition can cause significant distress and interfere with quality of life.
Key characteristics of Morgellons disease

    Sensation of infestation: Many people with Morgellons experience a crawling,
    stinging, or biting sensation on or under the skin.

    Skin lesions and fibers: This often includes itchy rashes or sores, which
    may contain or be surrounded by fibrous material.

    Microscopic observation: Many people view these fibers and other material
    under a microscope, reinforcing their belief of an infestation. The
    "matchbox sign," where a person brings collected skin specimens to a doctor,
    is a common feature.

    Mental and physical symptoms: The condition is associated with severe
    itching, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties, sometimes called "brain fog".
    Depression and anxiety can also be present.


Medical understanding of Morgellons disease

There is a division in the medical community about the cause of Morgellons
disease. Psychological perspective

    Delusional infestation: Many health professionals consider Morgellons to be
    a form of delusional infestation (formerly known as delusional parasitosis).
    In this view, the person has a fixed, false belief that their skin is
    infested with organisms, even though no such infestation can be found.

    Fabric fibers: A 2012 study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) examined 115 people with Morgellons and found no evidence
    of a parasitic infection. The study concluded that most of the fibers found
    in skin sores were likely textile fibers from clothing that became embedded
    through repetitive scratching.

Infectious disease perspective

    Association with spirochetes: Other researchers have proposed that
    Morgellons may have a physical or infectious cause. Some studies have
    reported finding spirochetes (a type of bacteria) in skin samples from
    patients with Morgellons, with some suggesting a link to tick-borne
    illnesses like Lyme disease. This remains a highly controversial area of
    research.

    Cellular origins: A 2018 review noted that the filaments found in lesions
    might not be textile but could originate from cells deeper in the skin,
    composed of proteins like keratin and collagen.


Why you should see a doctor

Regardless of the cause, the symptoms you are describing are real and
distressing, and getting a professional diagnosis is the necessary next step.


    Rule out other conditions: A medical professional can rule out other
    potential causes for your skin irritation and the presence of fibers or
    debris, such as textile fibers, sebaceous filaments, or even rare fungal
    infections.

    Receive compassionate care: Your doctor can provide compassionate care,
    acknowledge your symptoms, and work with you on a treatment plan, which may
    involve addressing both physical and psychological aspects.

    Prevent complications: Chronic skin wounds can lead to secondary infections.
    Medical treatment can help prevent this and manage your symptoms.

** Q5

#+begin_quote
how large are spirochetes and do they emerge from the skin?
#+end_quote

*** A5

#+begin_quote
Spirochetes are a group of bacteria that are far too small to be seen with the
naked eye and are generally not observed emerging from the skin as fibers. While
some types of spirochetes are associated with skin infections, the fibers seen
by people with Morgellons disease are believed by mainstream medicine to be
textile fibers from clothing or of human biological origin, not spirochetes
themselves.

Size of spirochetes

Spirochetes are microscopic bacteria with a characteristic long, helical shape.
Their size varies by species:

    Treponema pallidum (the bacterium that causes syphilis) is very thin, with a
    diameter of about 0.2 µm, but can be 6–15 µm long.

    Borrelia burgdorferi (the bacterium that causes Lyme disease) is larger,
    with a diameter of 0.2–0.5 µm and a length of 10–30 µm.


In comparison, the fibers that people with Morgellons describe are much larger,
often 10 to 40 µm in diameter—roughly 20 to 200 times wider than a spirochete.

Spirochetes and skin lesions

Instead of emerging from the skin as fibers, spirochetes cause skin lesions
through infection and the immune response they trigger.

    When a tick carrying Borrelia burgdorferi bites a host, the bacteria
    multiply at the site and spread outwards. This can cause the "bull's-eye"
    rash known as erythema migrans, though this is the inflammatory result of
    the infection, not the spirochetes themselves emerging.

    Research on Morgellons has, however, reported detecting Borrelia spirochetes
    in skin specimens and has characterized the fibers as containing keratin and
    collagen, suggesting a potential link between the infection and abnormal
    fiber formation. This connection is not accepted by the mainstream medical
    community, which considers the fibers to be textile in origin.

The medical perspective on Morgellons

Due to the significant discrepancy in size and the lack of a scientific consensus on a causative pathogen, what a person sees under a microscope as "fibers" and "eggs" is not believed to be spirochetes or their eggs. Instead, these are considered:

    Fibers: Usually textile fibers from clothes or bedding that get embedded in
    a sore.

    Eggs: Could be debris or artifacts. Spirochetes are bacteria, and do not lay
    eggs.

    Lesions: Chronic itching and scratching can create wounds and sores that are
    vulnerable to secondary bacterial infections.


If you are experiencing these symptoms, it is highly recommended that you
consult a healthcare professional. A dermatologist or another doctor can
properly diagnose and treat the condition, address the symptoms, and manage the
underlying distress.

Visually searched image

Is there a dermatophyte fungus in north america that looks like this?
#+end_quote

*** A4

#+begin_quote
Yes, some dermatophyte fungi found in North America can have a microscopic
appearance similar to the image, which shows hyaline septate hyphae,
characteristic of many filamentous fungi including dermatophytes .

Here's why:

    Dermatophyte Characteristics: Dermatophytes are a group of keratinophilic
    fungi (meaning they "love" keratin) responsible for infections of the skin,
    hair, and nails, often referred to as "ringworm" or "tinea" infections.

    Microscopic Appearance: Under a microscope, when treated with potassium
    hydroxide (KOH) to clear keratinaceous material, clinical samples infected
    with dermatophytes typically reveal branching, septate hyphae (rod-shaped
    filaments with cross-walls or septa) and sometimes spores. The image you
    provided shows such a filamentous, septate structure, consistent with fungal
    hyphae.

    North American Species: Common dermatophyte species in North America, such
    as Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Microsporum canis,
    among others, exhibit these hyphal forms when viewed microscopically from
    infected tissue samples. While detailed species identification often
    requires fungal culture and examination of specific spore types, the general
    appearance of hyphae in your image is indeed consistent with what might be
    seen in a dermatophyte infection in North America.

If hyaline septate hyphae come into contact with 91% isopropyl alcohol, what
happens to their cell walls?
#+end_quote

*** A7

#+begin_quote
When hyaline septate hyphae (fungi) come into contact with 91% isopropyl
alcohol, the cell walls are indirectly affected as the alcohol targets other
crucial cellular components, leading to overall cellular damage and death

Here's what happens:

    Protein Denaturation: Isopropyl alcohol readily penetrates the fungal cell
    and causes the denaturation of essential proteins, including enzymes within
    the cytoplasm and those associated with the cell membrane. This denaturation
    disrupts the proteins' structure and function, vital for cellular processes,
    including cell wall synthesis and maintenance.

    Cell Membrane Disruption: The alcohol also dissolves the lipids and
    lipoproteins that constitute the fungal cell membrane, which lies
    immediately beneath the cell wall. This disruption leads to increased
    permeability and leakage of intracellular contents, essentially compromising
    the cell's ability to maintain its internal environment.

    Indirect Cell Wall Integrity Loss: While the cell wall itself is a rigid
    structure composed primarily of chitin and glucans, the integrity and
    function of the cell wall are intrinsically linked to the underlying cell
    membrane and the metabolic activity of the cell. When the cell membrane is
    damaged and proteins involved in cell wall synthesis are denatured, the cell
    wall can no longer be properly maintained or repaired, potentially leading
    to its degradation or weakening.

    Dehydration: Alcohols, especially at higher concentrations like 91%, also
    act as dehydrating agents, drawing water out of the cells. While 70%
    isopropyl alcohol is often more effective for disinfection due to the
    presence of water facilitating protein denaturation and slower evaporation,
    91% IPA's rapid dehydration and quick coagulation of surface proteins can
    create a barrier that might hinder deeper penetration and full fungicidal
    effect, especially against spores.

** Q8

#+begin_quote
The last image does resemble fungal hyphae, but there are no divisions between
cell walls. They are all long & slender, but never branch. Fungi will usually
branch to form networks for nutrient distribution and for resilient
colonization.

Samples like those in the last image average one millimeter long and the sample
lengths exhibit a long-tailed gamma distribution with a peak around 0.5mm and a
handful of samples up to 5mm.
#+end_quote

*** A8

#+begin_quote
Your detailed description of the structures -- long, slender, unbranched,
lacking septa (aseptate or coenocytic), and ranging up to 5mm in length --
points towards specific types of biological filaments that are distinct from the
typical septate, branching hyphae of most fungi.

While many fungi exhibit branching and septate hyphae for nutrient distribution
and colonization, as you noted, some fungi, particularly from early diverging
lineages like the Zygomycetes (e.g., Mucor, Rhizopus), are characterized by
coenocytic (aseptate) hyphae. These hyphae are indeed long, continuous cells
with multiple nuclei and lack the internal divisions of septate fungi. However,
even these typically exhibit some degree of branching.

Given the explicit absence of branching and septa in your samples, and their
considerable length (up to 5mm), other possibilities should be considered in
addition to fungal structures, especially if these samples are from biological
or clinical specimens:

    Pseudohyphae from Yeasts: While typically shorter and often exhibiting
    constrictions at the junctions of elongated cells, some yeasts, particularly
    Candida albicans, can form pseudohyphae that resemble hyphae but are
    essentially elongated, incomplete budding cells strung together. However,
    these usually appear as chains of cells rather than truly continuous,
    unbranched filaments.

    Filamentous Bacteria: Certain bacteria can form long, unbranched filaments,
    although their diameter would generally be much smaller than the 200µm scale
    bar in your image. Examples include some species of Bacillus or filamentous
    cyanobacteria, though the latter are less likely in a context suggesting
    "hyphae."

    Artifacts or Other Biological Materials: Depending on the source of the
    sample, these could also be non-fungal biological structures or even
    artifacts. For example, in a urine sample, hyaline casts are clear,
    tube-shaped structures made of uromodulin protein that can be found in
    healthy individuals but also indicate kidney issues, and they are typically
    unbranched. While they usually aren't as long as 5mm, it's a possibility if
    the context is a urine sample.

    Muscle Filaments or Connective Tissue Fibers: In other biological samples,
    structures like muscle filaments (e.g., actin or myosin filaments) or
    connective tissue fibers (e.g., collagen fibers) can also appear as long,
    unbranched structures, although their specific morphology and staining
    characteristics would differ from fungal elements.


Conclusion:

While the coenocytic hyphae of some primitive fungi (Zygomycetes) are aseptate,
the complete lack of branching in your observed structures, combined with their
significant length, makes it less likely to be a typical fungal presentation.
Therefore, a careful re-evaluation of the sample origin and potential non-fungal
filamentous structures or artifacts is warranted. The specific context of the
biological sample (e.g., urine, tissue, environmental) would be crucial in
narrowing down the possibilities.

** Q9

.... aand it's broke

#+begin_quote
You're probably right about Morgellon's. These fibers are likely artificial. Their
size is distinct and I have never seen them before two weeks ago. No regional
parasites remotely match the physical descriiption. The fibers are likely a red
herring and there's absolutely no way I would mention Morgellon's to a doctor. I
am the type of person that needs more objective information to deflate anxiety.

The matchbox thing was hilarious (and very sad). The subreddits for scabies,
lyme and morgellon's are tragically filled with people who need a specialist to
conclusively analyze their living environments. The advice there is horrifically
tangential and very few images are properly recognized.

I have already been diagnosed with scabies, but they may not be responding to
treatment. The distribution of dermatological symptoms does not match the
typical presentation. It's possible that there is an allergen present. I am
stressing out because I don't know whether I'm contagious. I react very poorly
to common insecticides such as deltamethrin and cypermethrin, which would need
to be used in the workshop area of the house where I would frequently expose
myself to neurotoxins. Small regions of my skin become inflamed in those areas,
which may imply contact dermititus, but it's hard to imagine parasites living in
there for months without a host.

Being blocked from using that area significantly impedes goals and makes the
last five years of my life feel pointless.
