#+TITLE: Org Roam: Generate Code Notes From Repo Checkout
#+CATEGORY: slips
#+TAGS:

Some notes on emacs shell-integration for text manipulation.

* After Repo Sync

** To Generate (initially)

With shell

+ Use =C-u M-!= to run =shell-command= with output
+ Then =tree -L 2 /data/ecto/x.files/= then =query-replace-regexp= in emacs.
  - use =C-q C-j= to insert newlines in your regexp/replace

** To link to org-roam

+ enable links in org-roam and make a soft/hard link. If it's a hardlink in two
  git repos, you gonna have problems.

** To make notes

+ Add the file to your org-refile paths and setup a capture template.
+ Browse the source code and refile from there.

** To Update

... well this requires command over =org-ql= or =org-element=.

+ Keeping the existing notes still probably requires =org-element=.
+ it may be worthwhile to iterate over the headlines and generate a hash (or use
  =org-id-get-create=) but sourcing some =xpath= query /should/ guarantee
  uniqueness).

+ Using the =default.xml= file as input would be preferable to =tree=, though
  the command has options for XML/JSON output and even HTML.
