** AD Cert Services ESC8

*** Notes

+ Req. foothold credentials. implication is escalation to DA
+ MitM an enrollment endpoint (port 80)
+ Can protect domain by restricting machine account enrollments, but it's not
  sufficient. Best approach is to turn off ESC8-based enrollment

lookup later:

+ PFX certificate
+ NT Hash

* Pentesting: Accessing Ext. Networks

most compromises involve one of the three following techniques.

** password spraying

+ explore available linkedin accounts, get list of URLs
+ scrape contact info to obtain a list of emails
+ check existance of emails/accounts (can validate with microsoft teams search)
+ find available passwords
+ conduct login attempts by list of services, but slice across the set of users
  (this avoid lockouts)
+ on MFA accounts, time for fatigue (lunchtime)

** phishing

** webapp vulnerabilities

stealthier way to gain access

+ proxy mitm (use std. .NET/batch scripting to define a proxy)

*** To find vulnerabilities

Use google to identify branches of ext. webapp sitemaps hosted by an older
applications.

*** To react to vulnerabilities

Logs showing activity (Nessus/burp/etc) may imply that someone else has found
a weak point.
