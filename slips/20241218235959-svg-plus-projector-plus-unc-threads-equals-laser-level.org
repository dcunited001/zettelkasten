#+TITLE: Svg Plus Projector Plus Unc Threads Equals Laser Level

* Roam

- CAD

* Overview

** Projector

I have an old one with DVI input. I like modular things and found a
few ways to make this work: a mount, another mount, etc. I ultimately
went with a simple claw with UNC threads. However, a much simpler way
is to just use a tripod and a unc connector. It does require a
computer running a browser ... so a raspberry pi would've worked, even
the old A & B models, which are all that I have access to. However, I
can't find the converter since all my stuff is perpetually
disorganized ... while i reorganize it.

I ended up not using it, since getting the lines leveled was just a
PITA.  The tripod is much better because you'll need to balance
it. with the correct 3D printed part, it would be trivial to make an
adapter that fits a small /modular/ bubble level.

** SVG

+ yellow :: brightest color
+ orange :: still enough yellow, but thinner
+ grey :: illuminated, but not too much
