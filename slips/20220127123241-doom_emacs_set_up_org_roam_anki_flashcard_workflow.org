  + [[see https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor/examples.org][examples]]


* Setup

+ Anki is installed in the =desktop= Guix profile.
+ Anki Addons:
  - Anki Connect :: communicate to Anki from emacs
  - Latex Process Editor :: cmd-line options for SVG's
  - Syntax Highlighting
    - The [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1972239816][FORK]] is newer, but I can't install with Guix Anki

** Anki

+ If using Guix packages for emacs, then =emacs-anki-editor= is also needed. Otherwise this is just an emacs package.
+ New cards should be created within emacs =$_DATA/org/roam/anki=.
  - See my doom emacs config for capture templates.
  - See [[https://rgoswami.me/posts/anki-decks-orgmode][this blog on rgoswami.me]] for an overview.

***** TODO see if anki-connect can run as a shepherd user service
***** TODO check LAN access to anki-connect server

*** Anki Styles

** Latex

For latex and the xelatex that rgoswami uses, =texlive-bin= package is needed.


* Workflow

** Capturing
+ Capture a new deck with =C-c n r n=
**** TODO Capture new cards with ... capture templates
