* dc.files 2.0
- ideas for configuration from [[][20210305_garuda-fresh.md]] contained here
- needs to follow the [[https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/][XDG specs]] (while anticipating the trajectory of XDG
  Sessions).
  - the XDG software page contains many references to user/gui-level projects,
    providing a partial cover of the underlying space to survey (i.e. links to
    many projects whose configuration conventions would be useful to survey)
  - XDG Sessions in Wayland will allow various window managers to, for KDE
    Activities or XMonad topicspaces, automate config or persist/regenerate the
    state of applications.

** Overview
*** Requirements
- integrates nicely with XDG
- templates? meh... i guess?
  - how easy are these to modify? nothing beats =cp a.sh b.sh=

**** Gitsubmodules
i would like to have modules for:

- dc.files.kbd
- KDE =$HOME.config= folders
  - other window manager config folders?

*** Dotfiles Tools
- Dotter: rust, handlebars templates
- RCM: bash, thoughtbot (templates?)
- chezmoi (no gitmodules)
- Dotdrop: python3, jinja2

** Dotfiles Setup
clone to =$HOME/.dotfiles= or =$HOME/dc.files=?

*** integrate a new XDG folder
what would this be like?

*** Keyboard
** Desktop & Window Manager Configs
- =.desktop= files can launch applications from the terminal (with =gtk-launch= or
  =dex=)
