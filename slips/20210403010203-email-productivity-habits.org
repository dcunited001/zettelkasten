I hate doing the deep dive on stuff like this, just to have "something" happen
and never actually habitualize any of it. $#@!

* GMail & Email

- Labels vs. Categories (categories can be added)
- each label should get a color and its sublabels should get a darker tone of
  the same hue

*** managing large mailboxes

the main problem for me is that my mailboxes are so large, there is serious lag
in mail clients like Thunderbird/etc.

- unsubscribe to what's not needed before it piles up
- in a few circumstances, deleting emails is perfectly fine
  - on personal email ... meh, it's whatever
  - but if done with a filter ... delete the filter
  - i have like 150,000+ emails to deal with
- figure out which GMail Labels are absolutely not needed on a client and set
  them to not show on IMAP clients

**** 2. Use the default display density.

- recommended to just go with it for now

**** 3. Create new labels.

- Divide labels into sub-labels.
- And Use multiple labels per email (if necessary).

**** 6. Add more tabs (Categories) and organize them.

- click the Gear icon and click "Configure inbox."

**** 7. Utilize markers.

- recommended use is to mark emails you haven't acted on.
  - shows emails are there purely for informational purposes
  - and ones requiring action
    - (such as a reply, or the completion of a task)
- The only potential hiccup here is when you unmark an email thread, then
  receive a new email in that thread that gives you a new action item.

***** TODO possible to do this within Thunderbird?

**** 8. Enable automatic marking.

**** 9. Take advantage of read, unread, and snoozed messages.

**** 10. Add more stars.

- you might go with Gmail's recommended 4-star system,

***** TODO find out how this carries over to Thunderbird?

**** 11. Come up with a star system.

- perhaps use stars as an indication of urgency or importance.
- or use these symbols as a way to indicate type of action needed
  - blue i -- waiting for more information,
  - purple ? -- question needing an answer from you.
  - yellow ! -- light task
  - red ! -- heavy task

**** 12. Toggle conversation view.

[[https://emailanalytics.com/outlook-vs-gmail-which-is-better/][pros/cons]] of gmails conversation view vs outlook-style

**** 13. Enable hover actions.

- you can click a single button, rather than navigating to a submenu and
  selecting the sorting options from there.
- example actions:
  - archiving/deleting,
  - marking as read/unread
  - snoozing
- enable this feature by heading to the General tab in Settings, then
  clicking "Enable hover actions."

***** TODO how does this correspond to Thunderbolt

e.g. QuickFolder actions/menu?

**** 14. Turn on the Preview Pane.

***** TODO enable in GMail Labs

**** 15. Establish automatic filters.

- generally, be as specific as possible (unless it's easy to be
  comprehensive)

**** 16. Consider implementing Multiple Inboxes.

- create saved views of email filters (i guess without applying the rules)
  - view only starred emails with target phrase in subject
  - or view only marked emails from a specific sender.

***** TODO how does this translate to Thunderbird?

**** 17. Work toward inbox zero 5 emails at a time.

Two General Tips:

- One, process any emails in your inbox first before pursuing organization
  - process them first to index them later
- Second, just five emails at a time.
  - work toward *Inbox Zero* referring to an inbox full of emails that are
    appropriately marked and/or categorized, according to your system
