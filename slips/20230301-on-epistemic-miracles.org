#+TITLE: From Old Textbooks to Epistemic Miracles
#+CATEGORY: slips
#+TAGS: philosophy

Old textbooks always have a different perspective that we can look back on from
the shoulders of giants in just as distinct a perspective as those older notions
we dismiss today as being outdated or irrelevant. Donald Knuth's four books
exemplify this. RPC is an example of a type of interface that is consistently
reinvented. Another lense that's helpful to dust off quite often: the evolution
from thin-client/mainframe to fat-client and back -- this plays out repeatedly,
but the topologies continue to become flipped inside out, convoluted and
contraposed. Thus, these paradigmatic frames are much simpler to understand as
prototypes to recompose into metatypes when they can be distilled into their
simplest form.

Everyone once saw things in a different way that is increasingly less accessible
to you. You know the end of the story. Darth Vader is Luke's dad. Leia's the
twin. We still don't have VR, but most of us were caught off guard by the
ubiquity of mobile devices and the power of "social networks" -- which is such a
dubious term. We have always had a social network, but now it's
virtualized. It's been walled off to be less accessible to us, out-competing and
then atrophying the natural social networks we've been living with since hunting
and gathering. And to continue the application of the metaphor: not only did we
already have social networks, they are more similar to computing networks than
they would appear. The gossip protocol is the tech. network design pattern that
is encountered most often in IRL social networks. And every person has always
been like a computer -- we all process information like computers and the only
"differences" are illusory.

We are thus subject to the same spatial and temporal constraints imposed by
complexity theory. Moore's Law misleads us into thinking in terms of processor
units, but computational density, metabolism and efficiency are more
important. There are however some ways in which a person can transcend the
limitations imposed by complexity theory: you could correlate data/features
others see as irrelevant or you may encounter some [[https://te.xel.io/posts/2018-03-04-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity.html][Epistemic Miracle of
Serendipity]] whereby it falls to one from heaven.

In other words, your discovery of some knowledge is thus miraculous as:

#+begin_quote
If, O Indra, a hundred skies,
A hundred earths were thine,
Not a thousand suns could match thee at birth,
Nor the two worlds.
#+end_quote

Of course, I am not that. I only discovered what I needed and, as most people
undergoing inflation tend to do, I assumed that my answers would be as
miraculous for others as they were for me. But no. Were I to water things down,
it wouldn't be the same thing. Ultimately, in the information age, information
is cheap. One values a mentor anymore. Even though the lay person is more
capable than ever of validating information, Google and Facebook still prechew
all your information for you.  So what are we trying to get out of information
ubiquity anyways?

* Significance Of Stream of Consciousness?

The printing press wasn't perfect -- it wasn't free. The accomplishments that
brought LaTeX to the masses are historically significant. Overleaf is simpler,
yes, but it is not historically significant.


To be precise, LaTeX is electronic typesetting. Imagine the complexity of
working at some journal or university in the mid twentieth century and you need
to set type for some article containing greek with bizarre math format.

#+begin_quote
Do you realize how much control over publishing this createdenabled? No one
could publish unless they had the blessings of the university or journal.
#+end_quote

Like other technological or geopolitical developments, it is no longer it's
direct significance we feel, but the significance of its echo -- which we cannot
understand as anything but garbled reverb if we do not understand the source or
if we do not appreciate it's context. This thing from some important culmination
or inflection point in history solved problems that we can no longer
understand. We believe ourselves to be more competent and enabled -- but nothing
could be further from the truth!

#+CAPTION: Linotype Typesetting Machine
[[file:img/linotype.jpg]]

Hey, it's not as complex as emacs, but I think those people from the 1950's
could maybe do a thing. I was really just imagining what people would need to
do to typeset, but I had no idea that it would look like that.

* On Being, Cybernetics and Scale

You brains are no longer processing nearly as much information:

+ The timescales you consider: the immediate past and immediate
future.
+ The spatial scales you consider: basically whatever information spatially
  presents itself in front of your eyeballs.
+ You have very little skin in the game. You do not have to think ahead and you
  lack experience making decisions on imperfect information.

This obviously doesn't affect everyone the same, but it is limiting our
individual potential being and realized being as humans. And thereby, it limits
us collectively. It is too easy in the West to consider only the perspective of
the individual and forget the collective dynamics. When you further consider how
the lack of processing capability/experience scales socially, it becomes
affected by network theory and power laws. What empowers a few, but limits many
or most -- it amplifies.

Apply the ideas from cybernetics generally to socialized computer systems with
indexed data, hyperconnectivity and AI -- what you will find is the agents'
control over each others' attention shapes their experience. Their appetites for
information determine their internal signal processing capability and their
needs/desires/beliefs shape how they will interface with other information
processing agents. What happens is that the weakest agents become weaker, less
valued and thereby less connected.  As amplified effects ripple through IRL
social networks, the agents with stronger information processing capacity are
then themselves less connected to valuable information processing resources
(other agents/entities). The curse of dimensionality (CoD) here is particularly
relevent, if you've ever thought much about the dimensionality of epistemic
structures, there are many words for it -- monad, holon, Indra's net. In this
instance of CoD, the interdependent, uncountable and inseparable dimensions of
knowledge means *the network needs resilience*. Or some plan to make the networks'
systems anti-fragile.

But as you thin the networks, you stratify society according to factors like the
resources, authority and information processing capabilities of each agent
(person) or entitity (AI, corp or instititution). The social hierarchies become
flat, but there are too many people at the bottom with too little
value. Information becomes a manipulable resource used to hedge against
uncertainty. In a crisis, such as this, people either turn to despair or
faith. The difference is in how people decide to integrate the
unconscious. Dread and hope are first-order logical analogues of fear and
love. With dread, your object of fear becomes less certain, your experience of
angst becomes protracted and you experience time differently. The more
unconscious you become to the causes of your problems, the further into despair
you'll slip.

* The machinic molds your unconscious

But in these next decades, how technology facilitates our access to information
causes the machinic to shape our unconcsciousness. Here, machinic refers to the
machine-oriented cybernetic elements in society: newsfeed, automated feeds,
data. Without infinite energy & time, you cannot have infinite attention. What
does not become visible or audible remains beneath the surface. Over time, this
expands the surfaces in your psyche that form the interface to your personal
unconscious.

This is a major problem because to make people as deterministically predictable
as possible (with regard to a specific event), you generally condition them to
be unconscious to almost everything. This is an inversion of the way it should
be, where they can become conscious to almost anything and where there are high
levels of redundancy in skills/knowledge/etc. Instead, in our society, it is
convenient to render everyone unconscious to almost everything -- except in most
cases, to their explicit field of work or study. For example, significant
numbers of Americans will deal with psychological issues, but there are only a
handful of approved resources to treat these issues: psychologists, therapists,
etc.

#+begin_quote
To be unconscious to the nature of the unconsciousness is itself my
definition of insanity.
#+end_quote

I haven't fully eludicated my argument here, but this underscores the point: our
society conditions everyone to be as unconscious as possible. It optimizes your
observability and controllibility, in the language of control theory -- there it
is again, the cybernetics.

As you expand the range of dimensions in stochastic control problems, how does
that affect your returns on money/time/energy invested in processing signals?
Well, if you've ever thought the shape of an N-d Gaussian distribution, it's
really not hard to imagine -- limit the dimensions of variation, control the
domains of variable distributions and thus bound the probability measure to
limited ranges. Probability is like a fluid, prevent it from occupying some area
of finite-dimensional space -- does that make the system more predictable. Yes,
always. Prevent the probability fluid from occupying regions of
infinite-dimensional space? Well now it's really hard to say whether it makes
the system more predictable/controllable -- for one, if this is your problem,
you're already screwed though there are likely tools at your disposal. But bound
the probability as a fluid from spreading to entire classes of dimensions and
that will almost certainly help no matter how you model the problem.

But how does this unpack to be applied? It means that you optimize your
control/visibility of the system by preemptively truncating almost all potential
variation. If it's growing in your soil and you've never seen it before, you rip
it up because to you, that's a weed. You do not consider whether it has value,
what it's like, what it could become, whether it deserves to be acted against --
to maximalize predictability, you rip up anything alien to the categories of
nameable things that you believe are permitted in your society.

This is not just sad, it's not just stupid, but it's also ineffective and
short-sighted. When you engrain this weed-pulling behavior as a value, you
stymie evolutionary processes .. among other things I don't have time to
describe. You don't just inhibit society's ability to change/evolve, but your
own. By allowing what is small or different to exist or by even allowing it to
grow, you learn small things and pick up on new connections.  In the end, what
you gain in knowledge or information accumulates. It usually expands your
awareness in directions you weren't aware existed. When it involves the natural
world, you learn to read nature and when it involves people, you learn to read
people generally. When you preemptively seek to control, you end up affecting
yourself in ways that are tough to comprehend.

* The significance of significance

And what was the significance of significance? If our problem with the machinic
involves our degree of unconsciousness -- especially when the machinic
structures our life experiences and development in ways we can't understand --
we need to better understand cause and effect through history. Otherwise, as the
nature of causality changes more rapidly, we will lack flexibility and
foresight.

We should study what was once significant but seems to have faded into
unconsciousness. It's significance at one time or another -- even in some
potential future -- still ripples through the present time. If it's faded away,
you are just unconscious to its extrapolated effects.

It's another great reason why [[https://te.xel.io/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11.html][Emulation of Ancient Thought is Penultimate
Metacognition]]:

#+begin_quote
There are countless aspects of life that ancient people understood more clearly
than we do today. In many, standing on the shoulders of giants has yielded
crippled versions of ourselves because we were always molded and die-cast by
typologies of life experience now decimated by technology.
#+end_quote

Thus, we should cast ourselves back in history to reimagine how to look forward
to uncertainty. We should equip our thought with constraints and sources of
resistance and strengthen our ability to think through future problems.
