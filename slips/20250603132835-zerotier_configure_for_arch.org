* Overview

+ The free plan incldues: 1 admin, 10 devices, 3 networks
+ This is enough for 1 p2p network and space to transition into more permanent
  gateways, which require more sophisticated routing and firewall rules
+ This is also enough for multiple p2p networks -- which could help circumvent
  issues where you can't control IP addressing and need to shim in routes.

** Security

+ Running your own Zerotier infrastructure requires scale to get anonymity.

** Secrets


* Setup: Join Two Nodes On Layer 2

** Zero Tier


** Nodes
*** Routes

*** DNS and SSH

*** Control

* Setup: Join Node On A Gateway

This would describe the more permanent setup I'd like.

+ Run zerotier on two firewalls with gateways.
+ Create a two zerotier networks with corresponding subnets on those firewalls.
  - One network is for general VPN usage
  - The other network is for admin VPN usage, which would allow reaching more
    secure subnets on the interior.
+ When you join the network, you get an IP on a subnet directly connected to the
  interior network.
