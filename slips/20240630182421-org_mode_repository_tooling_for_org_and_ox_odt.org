* Automation

*** TODO review scripts/makefiles

There are a TON of good examples of tooling in =org-mode= and =ox-odt=

* org-attach

+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Attachment-defaults-and-dispatcher.html][org-attach]] brings up a dispatcher
+ files can be assoc by =:ID:= or =:DIR:=
+ [[https://github.com/jcguu95/org-linker.el?tab=readme-ov-file#example][org-linker]]: an alternative that tracks ID of files

+ files* -> subtrees, instead of subtrees -> dir

** org-attach-git

[[https://github.com/kjambunathan/org-mode-ox-odt/blob/89d3b728c98d3382a8e6a0abb8befb03d27d537b/lisp/org-attach-git.el#L107][org-attach-git-commit]] (and/or something) is somehow used to produce the commit
hashes in [[https://github.com/kjambunathan/org-mode-ox-odt/blob/master/notes/FEATURES.org][./notes/*.org]].

Org attach is used to "attach" files to org documents so that the data is
readily accessible from other machines (whether remote, local, file, link, etc)

** org attach =#+DIR:=

..... So this is probably what I needed to use to keep the notes [[https://github.com/ectorepo/ectorepo][ectorepo/ectorepo]]

This guy has made it way further along on problems I've thought about a
lot. There's good discussion on these problems in this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/v0k495/comment/iaiwlei/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button][r/org-mode thread]]

I thought i was the only person cynical/aware enough to strongly disdain content
creation on Facebook/Reddit/etc. Usually when I do, there's another reason.
