#+TITLE:     Arch: Setup DDC Util for remote display config
#+AUTHOR:    David Conner
#+EMAIL:     noreply@te.xel.io
#+DESCRIPTION: notes


+ Run =sudo pacman -Syu ddcutil ddcui-git= to install the necessary packages
  - =ddcui= doesn't seem to work...
    - it complains about SIGSEGV "Address Boundary Error"

* I2C

[[https://www.i2c-bus.org/addressing][I2C Bus]]

** Setup

+ Load the I2C kernel module on boot
  - =echo i2c-dev >/etc/modules-load.d/i2c-dev.conf=
+ Or load the module at runtime: =sudo modprobe i2c-dev=
+ Ensure that the module is loaded =lsmod | grep i2c=

** Probing for Connection

+ Get the i2c-bus device with =ddcutil detect=

* DDC

+ [[https://blog.tcharles.fr/ddc-ci-screen-control-on-linux][DDC CI Screen Control on Linux]]
  - This article discusses the UDEV rules that are needed for users in the "ddc"
    group to control DDC devices. Without this config, the =ddcui= app requires
    sudo.
  - These rules can be enabled and disabled

**** TODO create a hardware mgmt user, which can launch apps requiring UDEV/etc permissions from modified XDG desktop files. (or something along those lines)

** Using =ddcutil=

*** Basic Commands
+ Write
  - scs :: write to the monitor's NVRAM
+ Reflection
  - detect :: detect monitors
  - capabilities :: query capabilities
  - chkusbmon :: check if usb device is a monitor (for UDEV)
+ VCP (color profiles)
  - vcpinfo :: show VCP feature characteristics
  - getvcp :: report VCP feature value(s)
  - setvcp :: set VCP feature value(s)
  - dumpvcp :: write color profile settings to file
  - loadvcp :: load cp settings
+ Probe
  - environment :: execution env
  - usbenv :: USB connected monitors
  - probe :: monitor abilities
  - interrogate :: report everything possible

*** DDC Util Commands

+ Set =$__I2CBUS= to N in =/dev/i2c-n= from the =ddcutil detect= output
+ Query features =ddcutil capabilities --bus=$__I2CBUS=
  - these are the possible commands your monitor gives you
+ Run =ddcutil vcpinfo= to get information about standard VCP =0x00= hex codes
  - Information about this can also be found in  =man ddcutil=
