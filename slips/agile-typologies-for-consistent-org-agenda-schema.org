#+TITLE:     Agile Typologies For Consistent Org Agenda Schema

* Goal

I want to enter new tasks into Roam dailies with a consistent structure of
headlines, so the =org-element= structure can be queried consistently with
=org-ql=.

+ This should essentially be thought of as time-series data. If there is a consistent structure, then data can be created with the assumption that it will be easy to manange en masse to =org-refile= later.
  - the headlines should be thought of as segments in URL's, forming a consist
    set of routes beneath each daily entry
+ each feature in org-agenda lends itself to layering structure into data, but
  it must be sorted into a tree of _consistent_ classification categories.
  - tags :: can easily be associated to a language or project name
    - tag inheritence will be lost when the item is moved.
  - keyword :: TODO, idea, done, hold; can mirror the functionality of agile/kanban staging
    concepts like icebox, backlog,
  - prioritization :: can track the importance of an item
  -  ::

**** TODO write some brief scripts demonstrating org-element and org-ql

** From Semantic Web (SPARQL)

** From Esotericism

Ultimately these systems suffer from the lack of a true partition of items into
a consistent/simple categorization that totally covers the space. Utlimately the
problem is that, elements of "the monad" cannot be separated completely into
distinct categories.

+ 7 Hermitic Principles (from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion][The Kybalion]])
+ 8 Trigrams
  - Through these, TODO items can be categorized into eight headers /by
    considering the change needed/ for the action to be completed
  - This is too complicated & a bit of a mindtwist to instantly identify a corresponding trigram
+ 4 Elements (Fire Water Wind Earth)
