#+TITLE:     Sway/Wayland: Configure Greetd and Debug Sway
#+AUTHOR:    David Conner
#+EMAIL:     noreply@te.xel.io
#+DESCRIPTION: notes


* Problem

Sway can be hard to launch ... if not used to configuring your own window
manager. Sway has to be launched with =sway -d= if one is to debug.

* Resolution

**** TODO describe process of setting this up
**** TODO finish figuring out how to configure the list of launchable commands offered by greetd

* Roam
