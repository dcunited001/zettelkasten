*** Netplan
Netplan can generate the systemd =.network=, =.link= and =.netdev= units from YAML,
but meant for servers/infrastructure. It's overkill for a desktop.

  interface

* Setup
** Installation

+ Fed it the entire disk & used a generic password to change LUKS encryption and
  user password later.
  - I'll already reload and edit the btrfs layout. I'll re-encrypt with a new
    password before then
    - The luks master key for the volume generation is, by default, distinct from
      the passphrases used to unlock the master key
  - I'm paranoid about having LUKS equivalent to user password and about btrfs
    snapshots (overkill but idk, one pass shouldn't get you the other there)
+ I didn't switch =vty= to setup network before the installation
  - Probably should have.
+ After install, the system bootloops once at UEFI.
  - Reboot into omarchy. Clicked wifi notification. Initial sudo prompt shows
    up, but for the initial btrfs snapshot.
  - Restarted before initial snapshot. Tests robustness of init scripts, which
    is one possible channel for early issues.
    - this turns out to be triggered by the =omarchy-update-branch= script FIXME)

*** Change LUKS

Reboot into the custom =nixos-anywhere= ISO to reencrypt. The command below wasn't
working, with or without various luks parameters. I just used [[https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/blob/2df8c5f7e0a2aafb8c9aacb322408d2ed7682ea5/bin/omarchy-drive-set-password#L3][the command from
omarchy's script to re/set it]]

#+begin_src shell
cryptsetup luksChangeKey $disk <(read -sp 'LUKS Passphrase: ' lukspass; echo $lukspass)
#+end_src

The partition layout by default doesn't use LVM, so the [[https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/96/manual-installation][Manual Installation
method]] is required for that. I don't have time.

+ Except for the laptop's recent Garuda, I haven't tried a mono-partition
  installation. It's probably more of a feature anyways.
+ LVM is a pita and partition boundaries end up wasting a lot of space.
  - Aannnd I don't have =btrfs= CLI on this ISO?


*** Re-run =omarchy-cmd-first-run=

Reboot into omarchy, but the initial snapshot setup script didn't run.

[[https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/blob/2df8c5f7e0a2aafb8c9aacb322408d2ed7682ea5/bin/omarchy-cmd-first-run#L5][omarchy-cmd-first-run]] will run if the the =FIRST_RUN_MODE= marker is still in
tact, which gets set by [[https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/blob/2df8c5f7e0a2aafb8c9aacb322408d2ed7682ea5/install/preflight/first-run-mode.sh#L4][./install/preflight/first-run-mode.sh]]

+ hyprland runs this with =exec-once= this
+ =touch ~/.local/state/omarchy/first-run.mode=
  - neither relogin nor reboot seem to rerun it
  - just touch this file and run =$OMARCHY_PATH/bin/omarchy-cmd-first-run=

It turns out the welcome notifications did display and the command had run. I
got the initial =sudo= prompt & 'Create system snapshot" dialog from:

***** Add brtfs subvolumes for =nix= and =guix=

+ I don't actually want compression on =/nix= and =/gnu= subvolumes.
+ I definitely want to avoid having these be snapshotted. This means they need
  to be on a separate partition or at least directly under the root =subvolid=5=
  - IDK how BTRFS slides its snapshots, but i imagine it's more important for
    the earliest remaining snapshots on disk.
+ I'd prefer slightly faster builds and =guix gc= will de-dupe files with
  hard-links, so this ends up being a dozen or so unnecessary re/compressions
  and then deletes.

After reading through =cat `which omarchy-snapshot`=, the mounted subvolumes are
snapshoted -- so I don't need to worry about a second partition, phew.

I don't really know the BTRFS compression internals. It's unclear how much space
you'd save on writes to =/nix/store= and =/gnu/store=.

Running =compsize $subvolumeMount= can calculate that. Where =zstd= is used, get
something like =2.8G= usage on =8.5G= data, but there's =15G= uncompressed.

#+begin_src shell
compsize /{etc,home,opt,usr,var}
#+end_src

****** Anyways...

TLDR, what's in [[https://github.com/dcunited001/ellipsis/blob/master/nixos/hosts/kharis/kharis.chroot#L28][this same script]] should basically work, though I guess the
compression options are at mount time. Reboot into the nixos-anywhere iso (btrfs
can't be mounted if operating on the lower-level subvolumes)

To create them

#+begin_src shell
mr=/mnt/foo
disk=/dev/nvme0n1p2
dmap=/dev/mapper/oma
mkdir -p /mnt/foo
cryptsetup open $disk oma
mount $dmap $mr
btrfs subvolume list $mr

# nix/guix
btrfs subvolume create $mr/@nix
btrfs subvolume create $mr/@gnu

umount $mr
#+end_src

Don't create the directories yet. Remount first. Check =/etc/fstab= to make sure
the mount options match

#+begin_src shell
bops=defaults,noatime
mount $dmap -o rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@ $mr
mkdir $mr/{nix,gnu}
umount $mr
#+end_src

Edit the =/etc/fstab= and add lines for =/nix= and =/gnu=. These directories should be
completely empty when you go to setup =nix= and =guix=

#+begin_src shell :results output verbatim :dir /ssh:kharis:/home/dc :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env bash"
grep -E '(nix|gnu)' /etc/fstab
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: UUID=$uuid	/nix    btrfs           rw,defaults,noatime,subvol=/@nix	0 0
: UUID=$uuid	/gnu    btrfs           rw,defaults,noatime,subvol=/@gnu	0 0

***** Docker/Podman

(i'm kinda poor, so i don't want these in snapshots)

Create the subvolumes with =subvolid=5=

#+begin_src shell
mr=/mnt/foo
disk=/dev/nvme0n1p2
dmap=/dev/mapper/oma
mkdir -p /mnt/foo
cryptsetup open $disk oma
mount $dmap $mr
btrfs subvolume list $mr

# containers/docker
btrfs subvolume create $mr/@containers
btrfs subvolume create $mr/@docker

# user containers/docker
btrfs subvolume create $mr/@dccontainers
btrfs subvolume create $mr/@dcdocker

umount $mr
#+end_src

Create the mountpoints

#+begin_src shell
bops=defaults,noatime
me=dc
mount $dmap -o rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@ $mr

# system setup # -----------------------

mv /var/lib/{docker,docker2} # i already had content here

# make mount points
mkdir -p $mr/var/lib/{docker,containers/storage}
mount $dmap -o rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@docker $mr/var/lib/docker

mv /mnt/var/lib/docker2/{buildkit,containers,engine-id,image,network,overlay2,plugins,runtimes,swarm,tmp,volumes}
ls -al /mnt/var/lib/docker2 # remove later

umount $mr/var/lib/docker

# user setup # -----------------------

mount $dmap -o rw,relatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@home $mr/home
mkdir -p $mr/home/$me/.local/share/{docker,containers/storage}

chown -R 1000:1000 $mr/home/$me/.local/share/{docker,containers/storage}
umount $mr/home
umount $mr
#+end_src

Then add to =/etc/fstab=

#+begin_example
UUID=20b6e938-5951-4131-839d-be48a59b6b5e	/var/lib/docker         btrfs           rw,defaults,relatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@docker	0 0
UUID=20b6e938-5951-4131-839d-be48a59b6b5e	/var/lib/containers/storage     btrfs           rw,defaults,relatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@containers	0 0
UUID=20b6e938-5951-4131-839d-be48a59b6b5e	/home/dc/.local/share/docker    btrfs           rw,defaults,relatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@dcdocker	0 0
UUID=20b6e938-5951-4131-839d-be48a59b6b5e	/home/dc/.local/share/containers/storage        btrfs           rw,defaults,relatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@dccontainers	0 0
#+end_example


**** Mounts

These are the default mounts. This is running on the remote system:

+ =#+headers: :dir /ssh:kharis:/home/dc :shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash=

#+headers: :dir /ssh:kharis:/home/dc :shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash
#+begin_src shell :results output verbatim
mount | cut -f3,5 -d' ' \
    | sort | uniq \
    | sed -e 's/^/root/g' \
    | sed -E 's/ (.*)$/ (\1)/g'\
    | tree --fromfile .

** Configuration

*** Desktop

+ setup xkb in hypr, linked =~/.config/xkb=

*** Misc System

+ set root password, set user password, relogin
  - changing password requires reboot for sudo: uwsm doesn't necessarily end
    the user session?
+ restricted algorithms/etc in to =sshd_config.d=
  - trying to determine the best way to deploy misc changes like this


**** Remaining

+ how to configure a display manager? or enforce login?

*** GnuPG and SSH

**** Setup yubikey

For me, after the config, i just need the packages

+ pcsclite
+ yubikey-manager
+ yubikey-personalization
+ yubikey-personalization-gui
+ yubikey-piv-tool
+ yubico-touch-detector :: this creates a notification when yubikey is prompted
  for PIN

Still not sure what omarchy is using for package installation.

+ Run =cat `which omarchy-pkg-install`=, this contains the fzf menu
  - omarchy-pkg-install :: with =pacman=
  - omarchy-pkg-aur-install :: with =yay=
+ And =less /var/log/pacman.log= to grab the package names again
+ I didn't want to use =yay= until i was sure.

**** Tramp, =ssh= and =scp=

From here, I can do mostly everything remotely until I adjust to the environment
(and configure hyprland, etc)

**** Setup config for SSH and GPG
Mount old FS and copy over. Then restart

#+begin_src shell
# The garuda BTRFS disk (gh: garudahome)
gh=/run/media/$USER/$d/@home/$USER

# backup, in case.
# you may have created known_hosts, authorized_keys, etc
mv ~/.gnupg ~/.gnupg.oma
mv ~/.ssh ~/.ssh.oma

cp -R $gh/.gnupg $gh/.ssh $HOME
gpg-connect-agent /reloadagent /bye
#+end_src

+Now things like =ssh -T git@github.com= succeed+ ... (it fails).

occasionally I go through this in more detail. It requires more setup/checks on
=nix= & =guix=.

**** Fix =gpg-agent= and =pcscd=

***** Setup =pcscd=

I think =pcscd= ships with omarchy.

I needed to run =sudo systemctl start pcscd=, but it should get activated when an
application needs to hit the =pcscd.socket=.

#+begin_quote
NOTE: i'll need to =enable= the =pcscd.service=. socket activation isn't working.
#+end_quote

***** Restub the private keys in =$GNUPGHOME=

To restub the keys:

#+begin_src shell
gpg-connect-agent "scd seriano" "learn --force" /bye
#+end_src

After pcscd is running, this will succeed. still no =ssh -T git@github.com=. It's
failing on =libcrypto=, but having =pcscd= online definitely allowed this to succeed.

***** Setup pinentry

The problem was the pinentry. Running =/usr/bin/pinentry-qt5= throws an error
about =libKFSWaylandClient.so.5= .... okay =/usr/bin/pinentry-qt= is definitely the
newer one (wtf this is always so hard to answer lol)

***** Ensure =ssh= uses the right socket

Ensure this runs in =.profile= setup

#+begin_src shell
unset SSH_AGENT_PID
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)"
#+end_src

*** Guix

See [[id:f318689b-908c-4d97-8091-886695db6b58][Arch: Build The Guix Distributable Archive on NixOS for Omarchy]] to build the
archive.

You could also apparently run this to get the same result, but without the
=$state= dir getting set to =/gnu/var=

#+begin_src shell
wget https://guix.gnu.org/guix-install.sh
chmod +x guix-install.sh
sudo ./guix-install.sh
#+end_src

Or if you built the archive

#+begin_src shell
export GUIX_BINARY_FILE_NAME=guix-binary.x86_64-linux.tar.xz
sudo --preserve-env=GUIX_BINARY_FILE_NAME ./guix-install.sh
#+end_src

This install script sets up the guix-daemon [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/guix.html#Daemon-Running-Without-Privileges][to run without root privileges]]

Then set up =/etc/guix/acl= and run =systemctl restart guix-daemon=
*** Nix

#+begin_src shell
d=$(mktemp -d); cd $d
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf \
    -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix \
    -o nix-install.sh

less ./nix-install.sh
sh ./nix-install.sh --determinate
#+end_src

** Tools

#+begin_src shell

** Programming

*** Repo



*** Emacs

#+begin_quote
I still need to setup guix/nix, but getting guix to install the way I want (with
the =/var/guix= in =/gnu/var/guix=) requires it to be built on my machine.

Can't do much without emacs.
#+end_quote

I just set up the =emacshop= profile here, with those desktop files.

+ I had to ensure that =custom.el= didn't load initially. I moved it to
  =custom.el.bak=, since running emacs without =custom.el= created will probably
  create a =custom.el= file.
  - Emacs will fail to load until the packages are installed if it runs with the
    =init.el=). Just look at the list in =custom.el.back=, select them, install to
    =~/.emacs.d/= and ensure that no other emacs profile uses those
    =~/.emacs.d/{elpa,eln-cache}= directories.
+ I ran with =--debug-init= to step through the config file after installing the
  packages manually. After that, shut down emacs, then move the =custom.el.bak=
  file into place.

#+begin_quote
Note: i think these are intended to go in =$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/systemd/user=. Enabling
the =emacshop.service= links it under
=$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/systemd/user/graphical-session.target.wants=. IDK that I want it
persistently enabled if it encumbers hyprland launch though.
#+end_quote

From here, =mkdir -p ~/.local/share/systemd/{system,user}=

+ I checked =systemd-path= and these are there, though the directories are not.
+ I copied =~/.dotfiles/.emacs.hop/emacshop.service= into place
+ Then copied =~/.dotfiles/.emacs.hop/emacshopclient.desktop= into place
*** Doom Emacs



*** FRC

**** Setup =wpilib= and its =vscode=

Installed everything through the package manager.

* Response

** Initial usage

+ ~/.local/share/omarchy :: the distribution's logic in one place as a git repo.
  perfect. There's also logic in =omarchy-update-branch= to handle git stash,
  which is great.
+ s-M SPC :: Omarchy Menu
  - =Learn= quickly into a =walker= menu that lists human-readable default
    shortcuts. Very nice.

** Pros/Cons
Some notes from elsewhere not summarized here

*** Great
+ ships a tiling window manager by default
+ balances /emptiness/ with /fullness/:
  - the profile is pretty extensible (starship/etc aren't overbearing)
  - there's a lot of polish but i don't see anything i'd want to remove.
+ for a developer, kinda exactly what you want.
  - simple things are simple, as they should be
  - lazyvim, lazydocker just seem to work. as an emacs user, pretty awesome.

*** Good

+ following through the =first-run= scripts was helpful
  + The omarchy scripts are easy to understand and it uses its own "API" there
    -- it expresses the functionality to setup using the same terminology you'd
    use to automate things
  + e.g. =omarchy-launch-floating-terminal-with-presentation omarchy-update= runs
    if you click on that =mako= notification
+ easy to automate & manage customizations
+ nice screensavers

many more.

*** IDK

+ Doesn't include =nmtui= by default ... doesn't have Network Manager?
  - Okay. Uses =systemd-networkd= by default. hmmm editing the =.network= units
    seems simple enough.
  - =systemd-networkd= This leads into configuring linux on the server

*** Could be better
+ =.bash_profile= shouldn't source =.bashrc=. not sure whether the =.profile= would
  need the interactive content in =~/.local/share/omarchy/default/bash/rc=

**** LUKS block size

Wrong about this. It's fine. See [[id:c08270ed-9062-4fb4-b4ec-3cd2bfe39e52][File Systems and Omarchy: TIL about 512e SSDs
and LUKS reencrypt]]

* Data
** Garuda FS

*** Boot & LUKS
I hadn't gotten around to setting up =/etc/cryptab=, =/etc/fstab=, etc for LUKS
because I never decided on how to handle the dracut image scripts for
systemd-boot

+ Need to copy the partitions to an external disk so that their size & ordering
  are preserved

*** Nix/Guix partition

+ These had been created in a separate BTRFS partition using [[https://github.com/dcunited001/ellipsis/blob/master/nixos/hosts/kharis/kharis.chroot#L28][this script]]
+ They can be safely removed from the partition table

*** Backups

I ended up installing omarchy on the fresh disk.

Notes in [[id:e1f0e2af-c208-4fed-8717-3b6c5b49b804][File Systems: Being overly cautious with sfdisk and duplicate uuids]].
Easier to handle the partition images with UUIDs and Partition UUIDs in tact.

** Extant Configuration

There's little work on the laptop recently and I've contained everything inside
=$HOME= ... so that's pretty easy.

+ XDG_CONFIG_HOME :: was held together with popsicle sticks & symlinks
  - I have an =~/.emacs.d -> ~/.dotfiles/.emacs.hop= symlink for a barebones emacs
    config and a few things like that
+ XDG_DATA_HOME :: a few things:
  - OrcaSlicer configuration
  - Wine/Bottle configuration for Carbide Create (with a =C:\= filesystem
    somewhere idk)

* Migration

** Overview

+ Going to run commands via =ssh= so taking notes is a bit easier.
+ After pruning/draining files that can't easily be sync'd:
  - make sure it boots up again
  - shutdown, boot an ISO and copy the partition to an extra NVMe
+ Install omarchy
  - look around
  - check brtfs subvolumes, add subvolumes for =/nix= and =/gnu= that don't inherit
    from the main =subvolid=5=, potentially adding a separate partition for this
  - Maybe install again. depends on how/whether LUKS is setup within LVM or not
    - if not, then I need a second LUKS drive (hence the reinstall using the
      [[https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/96/manual-installation][Manual Installation method]]).
    - The main difference is whether you want to move partitions later as
      singular images. If not, then top-level btrfs subvolumes are way simpler.
+ Configure some basic dotfiles
  - setup =~/.emacs.hop=
  - make =.profile= consistent
  - re-shim the laptop's hyprland configs

** Escape Hatch

Kinda the most important part. I want to drain some of the scattered files from
the disk, but not too many so that the installation + =$HOME= dotfiles don't work.

** Omarchy

*** FS & Boot
+ LUKS+BTRFS :: I'm guessing the requirement is enforced through package
  updates in their custom mirror
+ Limine :: Boots via limine from EFI.
  - It's probably okay to assume this can live with the grub EFI image, but to
    be safe, I'm just backing up the image to a smaller disk.

I think dropping the LVM & Partitions approach & moving towards 95% btrfs would
be very beneficial

**** Partitions
I'm trying to get a feel for the subvolumes

*** Dotfiles

I just don't know that I want to manage two sets of scripts or hyprland configs.

+ One method for addressing this is to move some custom functionality into
  nix/guix packages, which I'm already doing.
  - e.g. the =hjinspect.jq= bin script that helps dump window titles
  - /Some of these packages/ can be installed into the main =~/.nix-profile= where
    the bin scripts & maybe some configs would be available in the environment.
    This would already be preferable to how I'm handling this shared
    functionality now (again... popsickle stick & symlinks).
+ Another method is to just start a separate set of dotfiles and figure it out
  from there.

**** SSH & GnuPG

It's a pain if it's not setup quickly

**** XKB

The custom bindings for =ISO_LEVEL_5= should still work

*** Profile

This is always a pain to manage across distros, but should be easier in Omarchy.

+ It's intended for developers. I haven't fully evaluated it (and I won't know).
  The installation scripts for isolated programming environments: a good sign
  that there's a more solid =.profile= foundation to build on.
*** Desktop
**** Notifications

Uses =mako= whereas I would prefer =swaync=, but idk =mako= seems to have good
support. I haven't used it yet though.

+ =swaync= is simple enough for me to decouple, since I don't have a heavy
  =home-manager= config.

**** Waybar

This looks simple enough to extend/customize. One thing that's missing is the
=yubikey-touch-detector=

**** SystemD & D-Bus

+ I had planned to explore adding custom d-bus specifications
+ I believe both these and system-d units can be installed through nix-profile,
  though the latter could maybe get messy.

**** Walker

I was about to shift towards =rofi=, but =walker= covers that functionality. The
=walker= author popped into a chat recently and the project piqued my interest.

+ It's a mix of =go= and =rust= with an underlying component =elephant=
+ =walker= has a creative design providing a service-managed backend index, along
  with a socket interface to provide fast access to results.
+ A bit of =golang= and a socket-based API are all helpful to learn anyways.

***** Rofi/Dmenu

With custom scripts or random dots, my concern here was cargo culting the wrong
scripts/patterns. A lot of what's done with =dmenu=-style interfaces should
actually be provided over d-bus.

+ I do a lot of this through Emacs' consult/vertigo anyways
+ I have a large collection of PDFs/cheatsheets that I need access to
*** Hyprland

The Omarchy hyprland is simple enough for me to shim what I need on top. omarchy
has some defaults, where you kinda want to choose which main configs to include
and how to shim the rest of what you need.

+ If you want their keybindings/modkeys, they're =const= in (e.g. SHIFT, ALT).
+ This is fine, as the point here is to gain functionality from what they
  provide (e.g. =walker=, =./bin= scripts). modkeys are easy enough to adjust to
  and I was already considering it.
+ Adapting to the standard hotkeys/etc and having a consistent interface from
  machine to machine is far preferable.

hyprland launch: they're using UWSM, which should be simple enough for me wrap
or both laptop/desktop.

* Compare Hyprland Configs

** Binds

*** Using =rollinglog=

Closest I think I can get to =C-h k= from emacs.

#+begin_src shell
hyprctl rollinglog -f | grep 'Keybind triggered'
#+end_src

*** Using JQ
#+name: jqBindsSort
#+begin_example jq
sort_by("\(.key),\(.keycode),\(.modmask)")
#+end_example

This first query's diffable as i would've liked (I guess I tried csv to line up
the tables)

#+name: jqBindsFormat
#+begin_example jq
map([
  .modmask,
  .key,
  .keycode,
  ([
    if (.mouse)           then "m" else "." end,
    if (.release)         then "r" else "." end,
    if (.repeat)          then "e" else "." end,
    if (.non_consuming)   then "n" else "." end,
    if (.has_description) then "d" else "." end,
    if (.catch_all)       then "C" else "." end, # i think this is correct
    if (.longPress)       then "o" else "." end
    ] | join("")),
    .dispatcher,
    .arg,
    .description
  ])
#+end_example

This just lists duplicated keybinds

#+name: jqBindsFormatShort
#+begin_example jq
map([(.key // .keycode), .modmask]   | join("	")) | join("\n")
#+end_example
