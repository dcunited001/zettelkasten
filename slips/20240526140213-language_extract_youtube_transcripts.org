Just some quick notes on this.

I feel like the average person should be taught how to at least use the
Devtools, even if they aren't going to program. It helps you understand the
magic mirror through which you interact with the digital husk of former
reality. We all have an innate intuition of physics and other aspects of reality
(epistemic games, logic, etc) ... but very few of us really understand how this
Web 2.5 thing works.

#+begin_quote
What if teach 75% of the high-school graduates this skill /someone/ uses it for
evil? We would be less safe!
#+end_quote

I'm not sure that anyone is safe in a world driven by surveillance/ai/etc. It's
arguably "unsafe" to trust a friend who doesn't understand the basic
implications of how they interact with digital information.

Case in point: contact lists... How TF do you think those spammers got all those
phone numbers? I thought we were safe, since everyone was ignorant?! Our blind
trust has been violated!

Anyways. I'm rambling.

* Process

+ Pick a video, press play, set the transcript language, enable CC.
+ Open the devtools and get the Network Capture running.
+ Set to 0:00. It's possible that the transcripts are streamed in JSON to the
  Youtube web client from a service that accepts interleaved start/end times to
  query. This would be annoying.
+ Reload the page. If you get an ad, let it almost finish and when ready, skip.

The video will fetch subtitles almost all at once. The URL will look like the
following with a bunch of client-identifying details in the URL.

https://www.youtube.com/api/timedtext?v=LhJhdeWcrII&ei=THZTZqzXA4mIkucP6_yi4AU&caps=asr&opi=112496729&xoaf=4&hl=ja&ip=0.0.0.0

Find it in the Network tab of devtools, get the JSON Response up, then select
"Entries". Now you can right-click and hit copy value. Open your favorite plain
text editor other than microsoft turd and paste the JSON. Save as a file like
=/tmp/treader.json=

Here's some JQ to run, but it needs post-processing because the fucking newlines
are irritating and ad-hoc I discover some unique snowflake solution to format
the text every time.

And here it is your +moment of zen+ glorius map-reduce.

#+begin_src shell :results output verbatim
cat /tmp/treader.json | jq '.events | map((.segs // empty) | map(.utf8) | join(" ")) | join(" ")' | sed -e 's/\\n/\n/g'
#+end_src

"[Music]
 the  treader  of  the  dust
 thy  clark  ashton  smith
 the  odin  wizards  knew  him  and  named  him
 quachel  utas
 seldom  as  he  revealed  for  he  dwelleth
 beyond  the  outermost  circle
 in  the  dark  limbo  of  unsphered  time  and
 space
 dreadful  as  the  word  that  calleth  him
 though  the  word  be  unspoken  save  in
 thought
 for  quarter  lutas  is  the  ultimate
 corruption
 and  the  instant  of  his  coming  is  like
 the  passage  of  many  ages
 and  neither  flesh  nor  stone  may  abide
 his  treading
 but  all  things  crumble  beneath  it
 atom  from  atom
 and  for  this
 some  have  called  him
 the  treader  of  the  dust
 the  testaments  of  carnamagus
 it  was  after  interminable  debate  and
 argument  with  himself  after  many
 attempts  to  exercise  the  dim  bodiless
 legion  of  his  fears  that  john  sebastian
 returned  to  the  house  he  had  left  so
 hurriedly
 he  had  been  absent  only  for  three  days
 but  even  this  was  an  interruption
 without  precedent  in  the  life  of
 reclusion  and  study  to  which  he  had
 given  himself  completely  following  his
 inheritance  of  the  old  mansion  together
 with  a  generous  income
 at  no  time  would  he  have  defined  fully
 the  reason  of  his  flight
 nevertheless  flight  had  seemed
 imperative
 there  was  some
 horrible  urgency  that  had  driven  him
 forth
 but  now  since  he  determined  to  go  back
 the  urgency  was  resolved  into  a  matter
 of  nerves  overwrought  by  too  close  and
 prolonged  application  to  his  books
 he  had  fancied  certain  things  but  the
 fancies  were  patently  absurd  and
 baseless
 even  if  the  phenomena  that  had  perturbed
 him  were  not  all  imaginary  there  must  be
 some  natural  solution  that  had  not
 occurred  to  his  overheated  mind  at  the
 time  the  sudden  yellowing  of  a  newly
 purchased  notebook  the  crumbling  of  the
 sheets  at  their  edges  were  no  doubt  due
 to  a  latent  imperfection  of  the  paper
 and  the  queer  fading  of  his  entries
 which  almost  overnight  had  become  faint
 as  age-old  writing  was  clearly  the
 result  of  cheap  faulty  chemicals  in  the
 ink
 the  aspect  of  sheer  brittle
 worm-hollowed  antiquity  which  had
 manifested  itself  in  certain  articles  of
 furniture
 certain  portions  of  the  mansion
 it  was  no  more  than  the  sudden  revealing
 of  a  covert  disintegration  that  had  gone
 on  unnoticed  by  him  in  his  sedulous
 application  to  dark  but
 absorbing  researches
 and  it  was  this  same  application  with
 its  unbroken  years  of  toil  and
 confinement  which  had  brought  about  his
 premature  aging
 so  that  looking  into  the  mirror  on  the
 morn  of  his  flight  he  had  been  startled
 and  shocked  as  if  by  the  apparition  of  a
 withered  mummy
 as  to  the  manservant  timus
 well  timmers  had  been  old  ever  since  he
 could  remember
 it  was  only  the  exaggeration  of  sick
 nerves  that  had  lately  found  in  timbers
 a  decrepitude  so  extreme  that  it  might
 fall  without  the  intermediacy  of  death
 at  any  moment
 into  the  corruption  of  the  grave
 indeed  he  could  explain  all  that  had
 troubled  him  without  reference  to  the
 wild  remote  law  the  forgotten
 demonologies  and  systems  of  magic  into
 which  he  had  delved
 those  pages  in  the  testaments  of
 karnamgus  over  which  he  had  pondered
 with  weird  dismay  were  relevant  only  to
 the  horrors  evoked  by  mad  sorcerers  in
 bygone  eons
 sebastian  firm  in  such  convictions  came
 back  at  sunset  to  his  house
 he  did  not  tremble  or  falter  as  he
 crossed  the  pine  darkened  grounds  and
 ran  quickly  up  the  front  steps
 he  fancied  but  could  not  be  sure
 that  there  were  fresh  signs  of
 dilapidation  in  the  steps
 and  the  house  itself  as  he  approached  it
 had  seemed  to  lean  a  little  a  slant  as
 if  from  some  ruinous  settling  of  the
 foundations
 but  this  he  told  himself  was  an  illusion
 wrought  by  the  gathering  twilight
 no  lamps  had  been  lit  but  sebastian  was
 not  unduly  surprised  by  this
 for  he  knew  that  tim  has  left  his  own
 devices  was  prone  to  dodder  about  in  the
 gloom  like  a  senescent  owl
 long  after  the  proper  time  of  lamp
 lighting
 sebastian  on  the  other  hand
 had  always  been  averse  to  darkness  or
 even  deep  shadow
 and  of  late  the  aversion  had  increased
 upon  him
 invariably  he  turned  on  all  the  bulbs  in
 the  house  as  soon  as  the  daylight  began
 to  fail  now  muttering  his  irritation  at
 timus's  remissness  he  pushed  open  the
 door  and  reached  hurriedly  for  the  whole
 switch
 because
 perhaps  of  a  nervous  agitation  which  he
 would  not  own  to  himself
 he  fumbled  for  several  moments  without
 finding  the  knob
 the  hall  was  strangely  dark
 and  a  glimmering  from  the  ashen  sunset
 sifted  between  tall  pines  into  the
 doorway  behind  him
 was  seemingly  powerless  to  penetrate
 beyond  its  threshold
 he  could  see  nothing
 it  was  as  if  the  night  of  dead  ages  had
 layered  in  that  hallway
 and  his  nostrils  while  he  stood  groping
 were  assailed  by  a  dry  pungencies  of
 ancient  dust
 and  odors  of  corpses  and  coffins  long
 indistinguishable
 and  powdery  decay
 at  last  he  found  the  switch  but  the
 illumination  that  responded  was  somehow
 dim  and  insufficient
 and  he  seemed  to  detect  a  shadowy
 flickering  as  if  the  circuit  were  at
 fault
 however  it  reassured  him  to  see  that  the
 house  to  all  appearance  was  very  much  as
 he  had  left  it
 perhaps  unconsciously  he  had  feared  to
 find  the  open  panels  crumbling  away  in
 riddled  rottenness  the  carpet  falling
 into  moth  eaten  tatters  had  apprehended
 the  breaking  through  of  rotted  boards
 beneath  his  tread
 where  he  wondered  now
 was  timmers
 the  aged  fact  totem  in  spite  of  his
 growing  senility  had  always  been  quick
 to  appear
 and  even  if  he  had  not  heard  his  master
 enter  the  switching  on  of  the  lights
 would  have  signalized  sebastian's  return
 to  him
 but  though  sebastian  listened  with
 painful  intentness
 there  was  no  creaking  of  the  familiar
 tottery  footsteps
 silence  hung  everywhere  like  a  funeral
 and  stirred  harris
 no  doubt  sebastian  thought  there  was
 some  commonplace  explanation
 thomas  had  gone  to  the  nearby  village
 perhaps  to  restock  the  ladder  or  in  hope
 of  receiving  a  letter  from  his  master
 and  sebastian  had  missed  him  on  the  way
 home  from  the  station
 or  perhaps  the  old  man  had  fallen  ill
 and  was  now  lying  helpless  in  his  room
 filled  with  this  latter  thought  he  went
 straight  to  timmiz's  bedchamber  which
 was  on  the  ground  floor  at  the  back  of
 the  mansion
 it  was  empty
 and  the  bed  was  neatly  made  and  had
 obviously  not  been  occupied  since  the
 night  before
 with  a  suspiration  of  relief  that  seemed
 to  lift  a  horrid  incubus  from  his  bosom
 he  decided  that  his  first  conjecture  had
 been  correct
 now
 pending  the  return  of  timmers  he  nerved
 himself  to  another  act  of  inspection
 and  went  forthwith  into  his  study
 he  would  not  admit  to  himself  precisely
 what  it  was  that  he  had  feared  to  see
 but  at  first  glance  the  room  was
 unchanged  and  all  things  was  they  had
 been  at  the  time  of  his  flurry  departure
 the  confused  and  high  piled  litter  of
 manuscripts  volumes  notebooks  on  his
 writing  table  had  seemingly  lain
 untouched  by  anything  but  his  own  hand
 and  his  bookshelves  with  their  bizarre
 and  terrifical  array  of  authorities  on
 diabolism  necromancy  goity  on  all  the
 ridiculed  or  outlawed  sciences  were
 undisturbed  and  intact
 on  the  old  lectern  or  reading  stand
 which  he  used  for  his  heavier  tomes
 the  testaments  of  karnamgus  in  its
 covers  of  chagrin  with  hasps  of  human
 bone
 lay  open  at  the  very  page  which  had
 frightened  him  so  unreasonably  with  its
 eldritch  intonations
 then
 as  he  stepped  forward  between  the
 reading  stand  and  the  table
 he  perceived  for  the  first  time  the
 inexplicable  dustiness  of  everything
 dust  lay  everywhere  a  fine  gray  dust
 like  a  powder  of  dead
 atoms
 it  had  covered  his  manuscripts  with  a
 deep  film
 it  had  settled  thickly  upon  the  chairs
 the  lampshades  the  volumes
 and  the  rich  poppy-like  reds  and  yellows
 of  the  oriental  rugs  were  dimmed  by  its
 accumulation
 it  was  as  if  many  desolate  years  had
 passed  through  the  chamber  since  his  own
 departure
 and  had  shaken  from  their  shroud-like
 garments  the  dust  of  all  ruined  things
 the  mystery  of  it  chilled  sebastian  for
 he  knew  that  the  room  had  been  clean
 swept  only  three  days  previous  and
 termers  would  have  dusted  the  place  each
 morning  with  meticulous  care
 during  his  absence
 now  the  dust  rose  up  in  a  light  swirling
 cloud  about  him
 it  filled  his  nostrils  with  the  same  dry
 odour
 as  a  fantastically  ancient  dissolution
 that  had  met  him  in  the  hall
 at  the  same  moment  he  grew  aware  of  a
 cold  gusty  draft  that  had  somehow
 entered  the  room
 he  thought  that  one  of  the  windows  must
 have  been  left  open
 but  a  glance  assured  him  that  they  were
 shut
 with  tightly  drawn  blinds
 and  the  door  was  closed  behind  him
 the  draft  was  light  as  the  sighing  of  a
 phantom
 but  wherever  it  passed
 the  fine  weightless  powder  soared  aloft
 filling  the  air  and  settling  again  with
 utmost  slowness
 sebastian  felt  a  weird  alarm
 as  if  a  wind  had  blown  him  from
 chartless  dimensions
 or  through  some  hidden  rift  of  ruin  and
 simultaneously  he  was  seized  by  a
 paroxysm  of  prolonged  and  violent
 coughing
 he  could  not  locate  the  source  of  the
 draft
 but  as  he  moved  restlessly  about  his  eye
 was  caught  by  a  low  long  mound  of  the
 grey  dust  which  had  heretofore  been
 hidden  from  view  by  the  table
 it  lay  beside  the  chair
 in  which  he  usually  sat  while  writing
 near  the  heap  was  the  feather  duster
 used  by  tim  as  in  his  daily  round  of
 house  cleaning
 it  seemed  to  sebastian  that  the  rigor  of
 a  great  lethal  coldness  had  invaded  all
 his  being
 he  could  not  stir  for  several  minutes
 but  stood  peering  down  at  the
 inexplicable  mound
 in  the  center  of  that  mound  he  saw  a
 vague
 depression
 which  might  have  been  the  mark  of  a  very
 small  footprint  offer  raised  by  the
 gusts  of  air  that  had  evidently  taken
 much  of  the  dust  and  scattered  it  about
 the  chamber
 at  last
 the  power  of  motion  returned  to
 sebastian
 without  conscious  recognition  of  the
 impulse  that  prompted  him
 he  bent  forward  to  pick  up  the  feather
 duster
 but  even  as  his  fingers  touched  it
 the  handle  and  the  feathers  crumbled
 into  fine  powder  which  settling  in  a  low
 pile
 preserved  vaguely  the  outlines  of  the
 original  object
 a  weakness  came  upon  sebastian
 as  if  the  burden  of  outer  age  and
 mortality  had  gathered  crushingly  on  his
 shoulders  between  one  instant
 and  the  next
 there  was  a  whirling  of  vertiginous
 shadows  before  his  eyes  in  the  lamplight
 and  he  felt  that  he  should  swoon  unless
 he  sat  down  immediately
 he  put  out  his  hand  to  reach  the  chair
 beside  him
 and  the  chair  at  his  touch  fell
 instantly  into  light
 downward  sifting  clouds  of  dust
 afterward
 how  long  afterward  he  could  not  tell
 he  found  himself  sitting  in  the  high
 chair  before  the  lectern  on  which  the
 testaments  of  carnamagus  lay  open
 dimly  he  was  surprised  that  the  seat  had
 not  crumbled  beneath  him
 upon  him  as  once  before
 there  was  the  urgency  of  swift  sudden
 flight  from  that  accursed  house
 but  it  seemed  that  he  had  grown  too  old
 too  weary  and  feeble
 and  that  nothing  mattered  greatly  not
 even  the  grisly  doom  which  he
 apprehended
 now
 as  he  sat  there  in  a  state  half-terror
 half-stupa
 his  eyes  were  drawn  to  the  wizard  volume
 before  him
 the  writings  of  that  evil  sage  and  seer
 carnamagus  which  had  been  recovered  a
 thousand  years  ago  from  some
 greco-bactrian  tomb
 and  transcribed  by  an  apostate  monk  in
 the  original  greek  in  the  blood  of  an
 incubus  begotten  monster
 in  that  volume  were  the  chronicles  of
 great  sorcerers  of  old
 and  the  histories  of  demons  earthly  and
 ultra-cosmic
 and  the  veritable  spells  by  which  the
 demons  could  be  called  up  and  controlled
 and
 dismissed
 sebastian  a  profound  student  of  such
 lore  had  long  believed  that  the  book  was
 a  mere  medieval  legend  and  he  had  been
 startled  as  well  as  gratified  when  he
 found  this  copy  on  the  shelves  of  a
 dealer  in  old  manuscripts  and  inky
 nebula
 it  was  said  that  only  two  copies  had
 ever  existed  and  that  the  other  had  been
 destroyed  by  the  spanish  inquisition
 early  in  the  13th  century
 the  light  flickered  as  if  ominous  wings
 had  flown  across  it  and  sebastian's  eyes
 blurred  with  a  gathering  room  as  he  read
 again  that  sinister  fatal  passage  which
 had  served  to  provoke  shadowy  fears
 though  quartal  uttars  cometh  but  rarely
 it  hath  been  well  attested  that  his
 advent  is  not  always  in  response  to  the
 spoken  rune  and  the  drawn  pentacle
 few  wizards  indeed  would  call  upon  a
 spirit  so  baleful
 but  let  it  be  understood  that  he  who
 readeth  to  himself  in  the  silence  of  his
 chamber  the  formula  given  here  under
 must  incur  a  grave  risk  if  in  his  heart
 there  abide  openly  or  hidden  the  least
 desire  of  death  and  annihilation
 for  it  may  be  that  quarterly  tas  will
 come  to  him  bringing  that  doom  which
 toucheth  the  body  to  eternal  dust
 and  maketh  the  soul  as  a  vapor
 forevermore  dissolved
 and  the  advent  of  quaterlutas  forenoble
 by  certain  tokens
 for  in  the  person  of  the  evocati  and
 even  perchance  in  those  about  him  will
 appear  the  signs  of  sudden  age
 and  his  house
 and  those  belongings  which  he  hath
 touched  will  assume  the  marks  of
 untimely  decay
 and  antiquity
 sebastian  did  not  know  that  he  was
 mumbling  the  sentences  half  aloud  as  he
 read  them  that  he  was  also  mumbling  the
 terrible  incantation  that  followed
 his  thoughts  crawled  as  if  through  a
 chill  and  freezing  medium
 with  a  dull
 ghastly  certainty
 he  knew  that  this  had  not  gone  to  the
 village
 he  should  have  warned  him  as  before
 leaving  he  should  have  closed  unlocked
 the  testaments  of  karnamgas
 for  timmers  in  his  way  was  something  of
 a  scholar  and  was  not  without  curiosity
 concerning  the  occult  studies  of  his
 master
 temers  was  well  able  to  read  the  greek
 of  konamis
 even  that  dire  and  soul-blasting  formula
 to  which  quarter  utas  demon  of  ultimate
 corruption  would  respond  from  the  outer
 void
 too  well  sebastian  divine  the  origin  of
 the  grey  dust  the  reason  of  those
 mysterious  crumblings
 again  he  felt  the  impulse  of  flight  but
 his  body  was  a  dry  dead  incubus  that
 refused  to  obey  his  volition
 anyway  he  reflected
 it  was  too  late  now
 for  the  signs  of  doom  had  gathered  about
 him  and  upon  him
 yet  surely  there  had  never  been  in  his
 heart  the  least  longing  for  death  and
 destruction
 he  had  wished  only  to  pursue  his
 delvings  into  the  blacker  mysteries  that
 environ  the  mortal  estate
 and  he  had  always  been  cautious  but
 never  cared  to  meddle  with  magic  circles
 and  devocations  of  perilous  presences
 he  had  known  that  there  were  spirits  of
 evil
 spirits  of  wrath  perdition  annihilation
 but  never  of  his  own  will  should  he  have
 summoned  any  of  them  from  their
 nightbound  abysms
 his  lethargy  and  weakness  seemed  to
 increase
 it  was  as  if  whole  lustrums  held  decades
 of  senescence  had  fallen  upon  him  in  the
 drawing  of  a  breath
 the  thread  of  his  thoughts  was  broken  at
 intervals  and  he  recovered  it  with
 difficulty
 his  memories  even  his  fears  seemed  to
 totter  on  the  edge  of  some  final
 forgetfulness
 with  dulled  ears  he  heard  a  sound  as  of
 timbers  breaking  and  falling  somewhere
 in  the  house
 with  dimmed  eyes  like  those  of  an
 ancient  he  saw  the  lights  waver  and  go
 out  beneath  the  swooping  of  a  bat  black
 darkness
 it  was  as  if  the  knight  of  some
 crumbling  catacomb  had  closed  upon  him
 he  felt  it  wiles  the  chill  faint
 breathing  of  the  draft  that  had  troubled
 him  before  with  its  mystery
 and  again  the  dust  rose  up  in  his
 nostrils
 then  he  realized  that  the  room  was  not
 holy  dark  for  he  could  discern  the  dim
 outlines  of  the  lectern  before  him
 surely  no  ray  was  admitted  by  the  drawn
 window  blinds
 yet  somehow  there  was  light
 his  eyes  lifting  with  enormous  effort
 saw  for  the  first  time  that  a  rough
 irregular  gap  had  appeared  in  the  room's
 outer  wall  high  up  in  the  north  corner
 through  it
 a  single  star  shone  into  the  chamber
 cold  and  remote
 as  the  eye  of  a  demon  glaring  across
 into  cosmic  gulfs  out  of  that  star
 or  from  the  spaces  beyond  it  a  beam  of
 livid  radiance  one  and  deathly  was  held
 like  a  spear  upon  sebastian
 broad  as  a  plank
 unwavering  and  movable
 it  seemed  to  transfix  his  very  body  and
 to  form  a  bridge  between  himself  and  the
 worlds  of  unimagined  darkness
 he  was  as  one  petrified  by  the  gaze  of
 the  gorgon
 then  through  the  aperture  of  ruin
 there  came  something  that  glided  stiffly
 and  rapidly  into  the  room  toward  him
 along  the  beam
 the  wall  seemed  to  crumble  the  rift
 widened  as  it  entered
 it  was  a  figure  no  larger  than  a  young
 child  but  seer  and  shriveled  as  some
 millennial  mummy
 its  hairless  head  its  unfeatured  face
 born  on  a  neck  of  skeleton  thinness
 were  lined  with  a  thousand  reticulated
 wrinkles
 the  body  was  like  that  of  some  monstrous
 withered  abortion  that  had  never  drawn
 breath
 the  pipey  arms  ending  in  bony  claws  were
 out  thrust  as  if  ankles  in  the  posture
 of  an  eternal  dreadful  groping
 the  legs  with  feet  like  those  of  a  pig
 me  death
 were  drawn  tightly  together  as  though
 confined  by  the  swathings  of  the  tomb
 nor  was  there  any  movement  of  striding
 or  pacing
 upright  and  rigid  the  horror  floated
 swiftly  down  the  one  deathly  grey  beam
 towards  sebastian
 now  it  was  close  upon  him  its  head  level
 with  his  brow  and  its  feet  opposite  his
 bosom
 for  a  fleeting  moment  he  knew  that  the
 horror  had  touched  him  with  its  outflung
 hands  with  its  starkly  floating  feet
 it  seemed  to
 merge  within  him
 to  become  one  with  his  being  he  felt
 that  his  veins  were  choked  with  dust
 that  his  brain  was  crumbling  cell  by
 cell
 then  he  was  no  longer  john  sebastian
 but
 a  universe  of  dead  stars  and  worlds  that
 fell  eddying  into  darkness  before  the
 tremendous  blowing  of  some  ultra  stellar
 wind
 the  thing  that  immemorial  wizards  had
 named  quaterlutas  was  gone
 and  night  and  starlight  had  returned  to
 that  ruinous  chamber
 but  nowhere  was  there  any  shadow  of  john
 sebastian
 only  a  low  mound  of  dust  on  the  floor
 beside  the  lecton
 bearing  a  vague  depression  like  the
 imprint  of  a  small  foot
 or  of  two  feet  that  were  pressed  closely
 together
