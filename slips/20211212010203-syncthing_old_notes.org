#+DESCRIPTION: notes

* Initial Deployment

** Hub Topology

+ One Server with laptop & VM desktop clients
+ For now, now remote access is needed
  - Only one syncthing client should send through VPN once configured

** Install

Syncthing should not be hosted on =tower.ansible.local= for long, as Tower/AWX is
running on it and using it as an executor. This whole server is going
away.

*** =tower.ansible.local= (server, centos)

In CentOS 8, [[https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/compose-podman-pods][docker has been replaced with Podman]], which can import
Kubernetes definitions.

+ Find [[https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-syncthing][linuxserver/syncthing]] image & pull.
  - Link describes how to configure ports, volumes, ...
  - The container runs under =system= user

*** Kratos (client)

* Later Deployment

+ Syncthing will be running alongside TrueNAS (or at least some NFS)
