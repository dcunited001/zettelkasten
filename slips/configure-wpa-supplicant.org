* Overview

** Ran into some problems connecting to a WPA EAP network.
- On Garuda KDE, it would probably work.
- Garuda Sway came with =connman=, which wasn't working out for me.
- I manually installed network manager after removing connman.
  * The NM tools I installed are probally not well-integrated
** Arch's =nm-connection-editor= only edits connections
- The tool prevents me from selecting some options for WPA auth
- Usually, AFAIK, my system's own =*.pem= certificate should be used in
  combination with my credentials to negotiate a connection to the router.
- Instead, the tool forces me to supply a certificate file or use none.
  * NOTE: i later discovered that my WPA should have the cert. disabled.


* Solution

Use =nmcli connection show $SSID= or =nmcli connection edit $SSID= to view all
the configuration details.

** I ensured that the =wpa_supplicant= package was installed
- Found that =nm-connection-editor= doesn't depend on wpa_supplicant package
  * probably not the issue
- [ ] inspect the interface b/w WPA Supplicant & Network Manager
- [ ] find where password are being stored (when wpa_supp is dbus'd by nmcli)

** TODO ensure that the connections have been reloaded
Via =nmcli connection reload=
** TODO ensure that my fucking password isn't in plaintext...
