Notes from GoAI2.0 ([[https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/support/video_detail/18/][gowin link]]) presentation [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAEwc6AZZXY&t=1912s][on youtube]]

* Hardware

** Software needs include:

+ Flatbuffers files
+ TFLµ C Code Libs
+ Optimization Libraries (optimize to specific microprocessor instruction set)
+ Hardware interface drivers
+ NPU Drivers

** For MobileNet v1:

+ over 200KB for coefficients
+ RAM to store the layers (approx. 1-200KB RAM)
  - safe with +2 MB
+ Better off with newer microprocessors

*** Some chips have NPU's (neural processor units)

+ these chips still typically use higher end device portfolio (Cortex M4/M7) to
  keep up with the software changes in TFLite

*** µSOC FPGA Architectures:

+ Highly flexible I/O utilization: supports multiple cameras/devices, supports
  displays, supports I2S microphones, MipEI3C
+ Up to 8MB of extended PSRAM. This is accessible to the FPGA, used to store the
  input/output layers.

* Real World Applications of FPGA solutions

** Classification of different image regions
+ different X,Y coords
+ downscaling/upscaling

** Classification of audio signals from different microphones
+ beamforming
+ noise cancellation

** Multiple Sensors processing
+ IMU + Microphone + Image Sensor

* GoAI 2.0 Architecture
