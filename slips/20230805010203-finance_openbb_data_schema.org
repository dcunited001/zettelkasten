** SDK

+ [[https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/blob/develop/openbb_terminal/sdk.py][openbb_terminal/sdk.py]]
+ [[https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/tree/develop/openbb_terminal/core/sdk][openbb_terminal/core/sdk]]

+ A tabular view for most data sources is listed under
  [[https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/blob/develop/openbb_terminal/core/sdk/trail_map.csv][openbb_terminal/core/sdk/trail_map*.csv]]
+ A hierarchical view can be inferred from the module loading in [[https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/blob/develop/openbb_terminal/core/sdk/sdk_init.py][sdk_init.py]]

*** Models

From within [[https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/tree/develop/openbb_terminal/core/sdk/models][openbb_terminal/core/sdk/models]], most data models loaded under
=lib=, but that module references others from directories under
=openbb_terminal=.

Some of these models have fairly straightforward structure under =lib.*=:

+ alt :: alternative sources (real estate, covid, hacker news), many sources
  from many modules
+ econometrics :: single directory, but loading from model/view/controller
+ crypto :: many files, many models/views/controllers

*** Analysis

Technicals can be found under [[https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/tree/564d08edd8714ae13c126afa4760b9e15af24e0f/openbb_terminal/common/technical_analysis][openbb_terminal/common/technical_analysis]], and
behavioural/quant analytics are sibling dirs.

** V4 SDK Upgrades

[[openbb][Pullreq #5225]] updates the SDK for v4, which would merge into [[https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/tree/develop][develop]]. There are
