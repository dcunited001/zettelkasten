I only have passing familiarity with the concepts described below...

I didn't quite cover all the C2 stuff: I don't have experience with it, but I do
have a few interesting ideas about it.

* Mapping the Internet

** Topology

The internet inherits topology from the shape of the earth. Since population
density drops off closer to the poles and thus demand for bandwidth, then it's
manifold is toroidal instead of spherical.

*** Expander Graphs

Balancing traffic across backbones is a consensus problem. It would be nice if
there were some solution to encourage connectivity.

[[BGP route][Expander graphs are globally synchronizing]]: (via [[https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-proof-shows-that-expander-graphs-synchronize-20230724/][QuantaMagazine]])

*** Topology of Graphs

Graphs are isometric with hyperbolic Reimannian manifolds. These manifolds have
curvature. Think of it like this: say you want to generalize the process of
identifying whether a graph can be depicted in 2D without crossing edges. Many
graphs whose edges cross in 2D will not have crossing edges in 3D. In higher
dimensions, the notion of edge crossings needs to be generalized:

+ it's almost impossible for the 2D edge crossing to occur
+ edges could be forced through 1-cliques
+ and 1-cliques can intersect in 3D

A 2D graph with multiple planes where an edge must cross through a plane between
some configuration of nodes with infinite edges is an example of a 2D graph
which cannot be depicted in 3D without crossing edges.

Knots in 4D are a good way to understand the graph concepts above. A 3D knot can
be trivially untangled, since you can push into the fourth dimension (video:
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dRwBAoAQlc][unknotting knots in the fourth dimension]])

That is, always untanglable unless the concepts as I understand them correspond
to different semantics. Semantics, eh?

Anyways, what is responsible for the crossing edges/cliques? What creates this
in higher dimensions? It's the patterns of connectivity in the graph.

#+ATTR_HTML: :style width:800px;
[[file:img/toponet_ricci-curvature.jpg]]

As the number of nodes increases while patterns in node connectivity remain
"similar," then:

+ larger scale changes in curvature should also exhibit: folding/warping &
  holes/loops
+ Short paths through the graph have special properties that relate the number
  of hops (intrinsic metric) to an extrinsic metric.

#+begin_quote
Qualifying what is meant here is a bit tricky, so an example: how many sq.
miles can be covered by 2 hops from your ISP router? 3 hops? 10 hops?
#+end_quote

This increase in dimensionality thus corresponds to a increase in volume covered
by n-hop paths. On our earth-bound internet this increases exponentially and is
then bounded by the earth's extrinsic geometry: it's a sphere -- and if there
are any aliens listening, please get me the fuck out of here.

Above, I mean "similar" as in "for some creative definition of similar" -- bite
me: look at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_graph][Ramanujan Graphs]] for examples of a well-structured graph with an
infinite limit. Wikipedia notes that they are "excellent spectral expanders".
Maybe I found a video on them while searching for videos on Spectral Graph
Theory and Graph Expanders.

From the SpectralFly paper (also the source of the picture below)

#+begin_quote
V. ROUTING ALGORITHMS

We consider 3 types of routing strategies for SpectralFly:
shortest path routing (minimal), Valiant routing, and Universal
Global Adaptive (UGAL) routing. In minimal routing, given a
source-destination pair (s, d), a packet is forwarded along the
routers on the shortest path from s to d.

... I have passing familiarity with the concepts /named/ above, but I have thought
about this a lot. It emerges as /intuitive feelings/ about connections between
math and other topics, then I work backwards to specify examples of similar
concepts. It's not process that's oriented around Logos (i.e. rigorous logic
involving symbols). That sounds weird maybe, but I don't mention that because I
think I'm special. I'm not even that good at it: I was not mentored or taught
and I lacked the structure necessary to reinforce fundamentals. I also learned
too late and burnt myself out. Instead, I mention it because it's just wierd. I
just know things and it's not the rational part of my mind producing the feeling
of familiarity.

** Addressing

RIR address blocks are not distributed evenly, nor are they necessarily
geographically bound. Doing so helps simplify routing, but the address mappings
for an RIR block are moreso determined by the organization's needs. For larger
organizations with data centers that need to dynamically distribute IP's (like a
cloud) then IP blocks may be local to a data center.
