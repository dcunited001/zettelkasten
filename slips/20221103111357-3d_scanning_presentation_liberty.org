+ Docs/help can be displayed to the right
  - tracks the user interaction and displays docs for the currently selected tools
+ Patching meshes
  - can interpolate across curved surface
+ import to solidworks/cad
+ recognition of scanned geometry as ideal models
  - 3d
  - 2d with plane/surface intersection
+ cross sections
  - use to generate surfaces when geometry is tough to capture
+ entities are listed
  - when imported into solidworks, the recognized features are parametric and
    editable
