#+TITLE: Blender: fix broken USD patch on archlinux
#+CATEGORY: slips
#+TAGS:

=./blender-git/usd_python.patch= breaks the build because of course it does.

+ manually specify the BOOST_VERSION as 1.80.
+ change in multiple places
+ build from checked out sources with =makepkg -e --nointeg=
  - integrity has already been checked 1,000 times.
+ install with =makepkg -i
  - now cmake complains about the =_GLEW=, so cross fingers or rerun yay with
    verbose options.

and yay USD is hopefully not breaking the build anymore, but honestly i blame
the democrats for any macroeconomic problems -- which is unbelievably obvious.



... yeh, crazy

anyways, i independently determined that the BOOST algorithm to eliminate nulls
from a texture could be used to accelerate compute -- when working with WebGL. I
would have fucking NAIVELY REIMPLEMENTED BOOST IN THE FUCKING BROWSER ON A
HUNCH. but i'm broken by poverty.
