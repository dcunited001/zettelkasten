#+TITLE:     X11Docker Basic Config On Arch
#+AUTHOR:    David Conner
#+EMAIL:     noreply@te.xel.io
#+DESCRIPTION: notes

+ Arch
+ Containers
+ Cloud


* Background

+ It's kinda like Qubes but with Docker instead of full isolation.
+ It can integrate well with Wayland.
  - One container can provide an X11 server from within a server providing a
    Wayland, where X11 and Wayland are mostly separate.
    - Then another container hooks into that X11 session
    - This provides a hybrid approach to isolating wayland from X11


* Setup

+ Install with =yay -Syu x11docker=
