Ahh the big questions:

+ BGP rerouting
+ IPv6 multicast/overlay
+ GeoIP/DDOS
+ teaching policy-based routing to do tricks
+ architecture for distribution of streaming media,
+ tiered caching thereof
+ dark fiber
+ absurd DDoS
+ Cray-Z big computers
+ using AMD DPU for OpenMP
+ justifying the "Mach 2" kernel with 100Gbps ethernet & novel bus topologies
+ questioning the sanity of "Automated Home" business models
+ Hey Cisco, what can my switch do?

** Getting Dell Compatibility

Open the PDF you slyly saved to your computer, which is navigable by mere
mortals. If the manual isn't sufficent, there is a tech manual. If that's not
enough, there are /useful/ manuals for each major software/hardware component.
Dell also has government contracts, but again: mere mortals are meant to
maintain their products.

... I guess Cisco's business model hit different -- partner relationship
management: job security for certified techs and breathing room for vendors.

10GE SR SFP+
10GE LR SFP+
10GE ER SFP+
10GE LRM SFP+
10GE USR SFP+
10GE LRM SFP+
#+end_quote

Basically, go with the SR ("short" range) or LRM (low power).
