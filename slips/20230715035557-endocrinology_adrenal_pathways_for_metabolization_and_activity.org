*** Interaction with Angiotensin II

#+begin_quote
During acidosis, circulating aldosterone levels are increased and the hormone
acts in concert with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin#Angiotensin_II][angiotensin II]] and other factors to stimulate renal acid
excretion. [fn:1]

* Issues

** Metabolic Acidosis

Various foods, including pretty much any staple of the american diet, prompt
fatigue with intensity that's increased over the years.

My own metabolic acidosis exhibits some changes that are orthostatic in nature:
fairly quick onset of fatigue when laying down (more than can be explained by
cortisol levels), changes in quality of urine when first waking up and, rarely,
referred pain in the kidneys until the first urination.

*** Effects on metabolization/excretion of Rx medications

Metabolic acidosis leads to increased excretion rates of pharmaceutical
medications. The following should all be well-understood as interfering with the
action/metabolization/excretion of pharmaceuticals and general chronic disease
processes:

+ processed foods deprived
+ high sodium
+ toxic fats
+ chronic inflammation
+ gluten allergies (leading to release of cortisol)
+ soft drinks (containing carbonic acid and phosphoric acid)

This is pretty obvious, but when your product is a pill, lifestyle changes just
can't compete with that. Here's a few examples of how regulating ignorance and
calling it health care leads to the confusion and chronic disease:

+ That osteoperosis, with as much attention as it has received, is not enough to
  sound the alarm on the American diet is outrageous.
+ That doctors commonly claim "well your blood is pH buffered and can't drop
  below X" is a fallacy, since the bones/teeth and other calcium/mineral stores
  indirectly feed the blood's ability to maintain acid/base equilibrium. These
  stores are not unlimited.
+ That there was so much attention on sodium in mainstream media in the 1990's
  was disingenuous: it _obviously_ causes _acute increases_ in blood pressure
  and therefore high doses of sodium can trigger a heart attack or
  stroke. Whether there are chronic increases is another issue entirely. I don't
  actually know, but that breakfast sausage might be your last. That the danger
  of high-sodium results from acute increases in sodium concentrations implies
  that the most serious risks are orthostatic (relating to the hydrostatics of
  fluid depending on body position) -- and thus would maybe explain why so many
  people die in their sleep or after first waking up.

Most of the nutritional content and non-food additives in the American diet are
constructed to increase shelf-life:

+ Sodium nitrite is a preservative, but conveniently turns nasty brown meat into
  a nice, marketable red color.
+ Trans-fats killed God knows how many people, but were preferred primarily
  because their tendency to solidify foods (thus slowing chemical reactions)
  increases shelf life. Unfortunately, they serve the same purpose in the human
  body, slowing metabolization of fats or the marshalling of nutrient stores
  they contain.
+ BPA and its replacements BPF, BPS, etc ... God help us all, are primarily
  added to line Bimetal cans (often containing acidic foods) to increase their
  shelf life. It's also a plastic additive that changes the rigidity of
  plastic. From [[https://lifewithoutplastic.com/bisphenol-a-bpa/][Life Without Plastic]]: "BPA leaching is especially a concern with
  canned foods, which often are oil-based and/or acidic." This is because the
  acidity of solution increases BPA solubility -- a problem mostly unchanged or
  made worse by swapping out functional groups and structure in BPA molecules
  for BPF/BPS/etc.

Again, if you're paying attention and have a college degree, esp. one that
required in/organic chemistry -- you should have been alarmed a long time
ago. But the truth is: you're either a fraud or you're not paying attention. I
am not actually that smart, but I do wake up from time to time and realize how
little medical knowledge I do have.

But if we're keeping score, then it was worth all the social derision I've
encountered to speak out on these issues for about 20 years. Because I wasn't
smart enough to know I was correct, but it turns out I was correct anyways.

All said and done, I do respect doctors for their knowledge/experience and I
don't believe it's their fault, per se. After all, we all saw what happened to
the honest or skeptical doctors during COVID: they were smeared and
"disemployed." One problem is their tendency of their reasoning to rely too
heavily on the research products of academia.

Also, I can't figure out this metabolic acidosis stuff unless I make it a
full-time job.

*** Lack of Medical Records Complicates Treatment

The lack of medical records means that a psychiatrist cannot easily become aware
of other issues. The only lab tests that I've been asked to take are absurdly
priced drug tests to ensure that I am not taking illegal drugs. While I was able
to negotiate on the need and price of these labtests, it seems that at least
simple tests to assert "anion gap" should not be expensive -- probably as pricey
as a doctor's visit for basic tests.

My desire to know what's going on with my kidneys stems primarily from wanting:

+ to be informed about possible chronic damage to my kidneys.
+ to know how to change my diet and to get someone with a fucking labcoat to
  tell my family "no, he cannot eat that" in a way such that they will listen.
+ It is unlikely that I will be able to hold a job if my mental status
  (particularly brain flog, fatigue and depression) consistently fluctuates
  while I'm simultaneously forced to deal with some potential workplace bullying
  -- which in the political atmosphere in America would include being mobbed
  simply because I don't want to take part in the "two minutes hate" of
  compelled speech against conservatives.
