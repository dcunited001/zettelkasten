* Ansible LSP with Eglot and Docker

You may want to skip to the "problems" section. This isn't exactly
perfect. There are many moving parts and a bit too much cognitive load ... but
when is being a polyglot with passable devops chops easy?

When you hear podcaster's mention "I don't use pulumi or ansible. i just use
python" ... the lack of completion & introspection are just a few of the
problems.

**** TODO test completion once ansible-galaxy dependencies are installed

Also test with VSCode...



** Ansible Setup

To test, clone the [[github:geerlingguy/ansible-vagrant-examples][ansible-vagrant-examples]], [[github:geerlingguy/ansible-role-gitlab][ansible-role-gitlab]] or [[https://ansible.jeffgeerling.com/#projects][one of
geerling's Ansible Projects]], then add YAML for docker compose. The packer &
vagrant projects could all be run on VM's, but will expect a virtualization
provider like virtio.

*** Collections

After the =ansible-language-server= starts up, it needs to know about the galaxy
collections. You could download some of these as Ubunutu packages, but that will
only get a handful of them.

The docker image will contain a bind-mount to your project. Ensure that the
process in the container [[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#collections-paths][finds the ansible collections somehow]].

*** Linting

When =ansible-lint= runs, it needs to pick up configuration either as
=.ansible-lint= or as arguments passed to the LSP server.

** Completion Setup

*** Corfu

See [[https://github.com/minad/corfu/wiki#configuring-corfu-for-eglot][configuring corfu for eglot]]

*** Cape/Capf

Eglot sets =completion-at-point-functions= to =(eglot-completion-at-point t)=
when it's active. According to [[https://github.com/minad/cape#capf-buster---cache-busting][minad/cape]] and issues [[https://github.com/minad/cape/issues/81][#81]]and [[https://github.com/minad/cape/issues/79][#79]], the completion
cache can need to be busted.

This can be accomplished in one of two ways:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; locally and by prepending
(setq-local completion-at-point-functions
            (list (cape-capf-buster #'some-caching-capf)))

; or as advice any time it is called
(advice-add 'eglot-completion-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-buster)
#+end_src


** Setup =.dir-locals.el=

See [[https://2metz.fr/blog/configuring-emacs-eglot-lsp-with-docker-containers/][configuring eglot to use docker containers.]] According to the post,
[[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/blob/28c1c3a52e1cb7fa7260815eb53700f348d48dd5/eglot.el#L402-L404][eglot
with docker]] requires =eglot-withhold-process-id=

Ensure that your buffers actually get set to ansible-mode -- which is also a
problem in VSCode (see where it mentions "[[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible][modelines]]" what are those?)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (expand-file-name ".dir-locals.el" build-dir)
((nil
  . ((eglot-withhold-process-id . t)

     ;; NOTE!! YAML-MODE won't work, it must be k1LoW/emacs-ansible

     (eglot-workspace-configuration

                   ;; Workaround for bug https://issues.guix.gnu.org/43818.
                   (root-dir* (directory-file-name root-dir))
                   (docker-run-cmd '("docker" "run" "--rm" "-i"))
                   (docker-volume-args
                    (format
                     (string-join '("type=bind" "src=%s" "dst=/root/project") ",") root-dir*)))

              (make-local-variable 'eglot-server-programs)
              ;; (require 'a) ; if eglot treats an a-list as a list, not a dict

              (require 'cl-lib)
              (cl-pushnew
               `(yaml-mode ,@docker-run-cmd
                          "--volume" ,docker-volume-args
                          "dc/lsp-docker"
                          "ansible-language-server" "--stdio")
               eglot-server-programs)
    ))
  )))))

#+end_src

** Server Startup

You may configure a startup script per-project or in your home directory.

IMO, having a template for a per-project startup script is probably the best way
to go.

#+begin_src sh
exec docker run --rm -i --volume # ....
#+end_src

**** TODO Update the startup script

The =lsp-docker= requirements state that it needs an =entrypoint=, which
constrains passing arguments. If so, then the =Dockerfile= example in
=lsp-docker= always needs to be modified. If not, then it may be possible to
simply have a single =~/.emacs.d/eglot-docker.sh= startup script ... in which
case the =.dir-locals.el= above isn't really needed. This is because:

+ =eglot-alternatives= is allowed to produce multiple results for a given mode
+ the result can include a function evaluated at runtime which thus can produce
  the assumed project directory -- above, =root-dir*=


**  Server Configuration

LSP configuration common to all/most projects should go in the
=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME= directory for that LSP, if it's supported.

+ if using Emacs LSP, it has settings that likely need to be configured within a
  =.dir-locals.el= for the project.
+ For =lsp-docker=, this settings can be found in =.lsp-docker=.

For eglot, you'll need to define [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eglot/Project_002dspecific-configuration.html][eglot-workspace-configuration]] for the project
and to customize [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eglot/User_002dspecific-configuration.html][eglot-server-programs]]

So for =eglot= ensure the above =.dir-locals.el= includes the LSP config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; ...
(eglot-workspace-configuration
 . (:ansible
    (:validation (:enabled t :lint (:enabled t)))))
#+end_src

**** TODO fix issue with relative/absolute paths

Relevant key strings in eglot.el

+ [ ] :rootUri
+ [ ] (eglot--lambda ...)
+ [ ]

#+begin_example emacs-lisp
(eglot-workspace-folders (eglot-current-server))

;; returns

[(:uri "file:///home/dc/src/ansible-role-gitlab"
  :name "~/src/ansible-role-gitlab/")]
#+end_example

To get around this, it requires comparing the path translation methods:

+ For LSP Docker: [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker/blob/master/lsp-docker.el#L56-L77][lsp-docker--uri->path and lsp-docker--path->uri]]
+ For Eglot: [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/blob/master/eglot.el#L1617-L1659][eglot--uri-to-path and eglot--path-to-uri]]

Specifically, wrt how LSP Docker juggles this information around. Eglot seems to
do less with it. I would bet that LSP Docker isn't widely used -- since if the
dependency paths aren't 100% consistent between the host/container, this
represents some major configuration overhead. see the [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker#registering-a-language-server-using-a-persistent-configuration-file][mappings]] key.

Actually, nevermind, the [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker/blob/master/lsp-docker.el#L376-L380][path mappings must be completely within the project
directory]]. So it basically works for NodeJS projects where all deps
are within the project.

* Docker

Read about the [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker#custom-language-server-containers][constraints on Docker LSP containers]]: they must be launched in
=stdio= mode and have the LSP process as an entrypoint; i.e. run with =docker
start=.

The =repology.el= emacs package is extremely useful for quickly plowing through
this packaging business.

** Dockerfile

The container on Docker Hub is an old build, you can try that [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker/blob/master/lsp-docker-langservers/Dockerfile][Dockerfile]] or
build the image below. It's been edited a bit.

+ I added =npm i -g @ansible/ansible-language-server= and Ansible dependencies
+ The image currently installs Node 18. See the nodejs
  [[https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/main/Dockerfile-debian.template][Dockerfile-debian.template]] for an alternate installation.
+ It's updated to run on a Ubuntu Lunar 23.04 container.

Also =ansible-language-server= actually requires Node 14. I didn't feel like
downloading that from the Node =deb=, so I've just installed it from mainline.

=interpreterPath= just provides the paths for CLI tools which happen to be in a
=venv= or elsewhere on the system.

* Problems With LSP In Docker

** Image Management

Once an image requires project-specific dependencies, you need to maintain
specific images per-project... luckly the =ansible-galaxy= collections /should/
be found within the project itself.

** Emacs Config

Each project will need a =.dir-locals= with =eglot-workspace-configuration= and
=eglot-withhold-process-id=. The former is where your LSP server config goes.

You should be able to share =eglot-server-programs= configurations across your
entire emacs config. This depends on how you define the LSP server -- i.e.  you
may use a common =lsp-docker-x.sh= startup script or can get by with a common
server for the language. If not, you should be able to =docker run= when eglot
asks you for a server to start. The code for setting =eglot-server-programs= in
=.dir-locals.el= is a bit nasty, so you'll definitely want to do this if you
can.

** Ship in a Bottle

Placing a container boundary around the LSP server process makes it a bit opaque
-- though TBH LSP is already fairly opaque anyways. You'll definitely want
another platform or editor to test against to ensure you're getting the expected
capabilities/behavior.

** Navigate to Definition

Whether using Emacs LSP with lsp-docker.el or eglot or VSCode, it's hard to
reconcile paths for "navigate to definition" or other lookups that might travel
outside your project.

So LSP-in-Docker can find your dependency, but unless:

+ your dependency relative paths for deps match =1:1= from the host machine to
  the container
+ or you provide specific mappings for each dependency for which you want
  dependency resolution, which hopefully doesn't include varying version numbers

Then it really doesn't matter what host platform you have, The docker LSP is
going to return paths that don't match.

If you have python =venv= that match exactly between your host/container, then
it may work.

*** Ansible LSP is an Exception

Ansible-language-server is a bit of an exception, but for reflection, the VSCode
plugin uses a combination of:

+ ansible-lightspeed: this uses IBM Watson.
+ ansible-doc: This is being used for the VSCode hover functionality.
+ ansible-playbook: this and the navigator references are only in =runner.ts=
+ ansible-navigator: as one method to exec playbooks, not for doc lookup AFAIK
  -- i checked both vscode-ansible and ansible-language-server sources to try to
  "feature-diff" VSCode and Emacs.

  Some of this code is only in the VSCode plugin, not in the language
  server. IMO, the language server should've been written in Python
  (i.e. ansible-navigator should simply be extended to act as LSP; it's very
  close and can control/delegate to most of the other Ansible tools).

  In typical microsoft fashion, you're shielded from most details, so it's
  actually difficult to see beyond marketing as long as everything "just works"
  -- but it doesn't "just work." Regardless of which platform you're on, the
  configuration surface area is about the same. If it seems easy, your
  tasks/workflow is streamlined: if you don't notice the limitations, it's
  because you haven't tried to color outside the lines. Maybe you don't need to.

*** Sourcegraph is another exception

This is a different way of navigating to code.

** Packages in Containers

LSP is such a pain where you need it most -- ad hoc YAML variants where most
tooling can't be bothered to properly support [[https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/25/how-to-configure-yaml-schema-to-make-editing-files-easier][YAML]] [[https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2021/yaml-schemas/][schema]] files ... and where
it'd be a pain to configure your editor to support it anyways.

At least helm-ls was written in a decent programming language ... oh but
surprise, surprise: it's _not_ available on Ubuntu.

#+begin_quote
Why oh why would you ever want to use Arch? Oh ... that's right because you're a
polyglot on the bleeding edge. Well then: you can't have nice things like
"Matlab installers" or "GPU Drivers that just handle DKMS for you."

Oh, in two weeks, get ready to drop everything and install Archlinux from
scratch again. I hope you remember exactly which =/etc/random= files you
changed. That by itself makes Nix & Guix worth it. It's too bad that corporate
Linux distro's use inefficient/slow package management tools that will never
evolve. Their cost structure doesn't cover it, but if it's not corporate then
proprietary software vendors treat it like it doesn't exist.

Oh and both Nix & Guix can build to docker containers.
#+end_quote


* Misc Notes

** Getting Eglot to Attach to an External Process Directly

AFAIK, the =eglot.el= code is not structured such that you can tell eglot
"here's a process" and "here's it's output buffer in emacs." At least that's
what =eglot--connect= implies., although the source mentions that
=eglot-lsp-server= is really just a subclass of =jsonrpc-process-connection=

This would, i think, involve launching the container as an inferior process with
=socat= to listen for input from =eglot=, which itself would launch =socat=
... maybe that's not quite right. I'm not sure. It would never be any simpler
than just calling docker/compose ... I don't think.

The advantage of connecting to a remote process would be that you could launch
the container outside of the editor. If the process' stdin/stdout file
descriptors can be passed to eglot, it could invoke a fairly basic LSP-naive
command and it may not need socat.

#+begin_quote
In this case, then maybe LSP could truly be editor independent, esp. if the
launching program could broker multiple client connections to the LSP
process. Then, you could launch VS Code and also connect with Emacs/Vim ... or
have multiple developers connected to the same project, though that doesn't
really scale well because it requires that one/both devs are remote to the
computer
