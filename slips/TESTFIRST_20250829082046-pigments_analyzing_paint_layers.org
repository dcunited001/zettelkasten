Yeh, it was lead paint under that door's paint layers. I tested it. Multiple
positives. The door has been there for 20 years. In the past 10 years, _maybe_
eight people outside my family have ever seen it. It would not be obvious.
In the past 2-3 years, it's been flaking small chunks off.

Also, other tests were positive on some wicker furniture. Piece of advice: avoid
antique wicker furniture. Sadly, it will absolutely flake.

No idea whether this is significant or not. I doubt any doctor that I have would
order a lead test unless I press the issue. It would need to be a hair test
AFAIK and it's not like it matters. I'm too poor to do all the podcast circus
bloodwork.

And mold tests? If it isn't a genetic, toxicological or histological test, it's
probably a waste of time. Not like it matters to anyone else (... not a single
person here to ever notice). There's definitely a shitton of mold though. And if
I test it, I can instantly budget dealing with it right? Yeh. NO ONE CARES.

  - TL;DR: only relevant here by analogy: something similar to epitaxial strain
    occurs for paint layers of different media, which would be exacerbated by
    cyclic heat/humidity flux. Acrylic paint layers don't really exhibit tearing
    in response to this (it's plastic... /almost too plastic/, so in response to )

* Overview

Regardless of the cause/materials, the mechanics of the differing response of
various paint layers (see below) are markedly more physical than chemical.

+ There is epitaxial strain from "incompatible" layers
+ Where the strain exceeds the material's strain limit or local elasticity, a
  void is introduced. This locally modifies the parameters (or effects) of the
  Cauchy strain tensor to weaken the material.

See caveats below. Trying to google for lead underneath newer layers (possibly
with humidity damage) was impossible every time I tried over the past 2-3 years.
ONLY the "classic pattern"
#+end_quote

Over the past few years I've noticed a weird peeling pattern in on a partly
sanded 15+ year old door (used and much older). IDK, but the lower layers of
paint are peeling in a very strange way.

+ There may be layers of primer in between some color layers
+ The outermost layers are almost certainly acrylic
+ There's a small cracking pattern seen in areas where the paint is removed, but
  this could be explained by =latex ⊗ on primer ⊗ on oil-base=
+ Acrylic isn't affected as much by strain, but has elasticity. This can be seen
  as it can be stretched when it peels. It is essentially LATEX afaik.
+ Lead paint is known to accommodate shifting in linseed oils, but this is a a
  property that results from /cross-linking/ that forms (which is analogous to the
  sulphur bridges that strengthen and/or attenuate the properties of rubber).
  - Given a breakdown of dried paint (via humidity, aging, etc), this would
    change the manifestation of alligator cracking in exposed lead paint.
  - the alligator cracking (if present) in the lower levels of paint lacking
    permeability to the wood substrate should still exhibit the more typical
    appearance _with large scale, rectangular features with mostly continuous
    lines that include some curvature with bifurcations_
  - latex paint on top of the lead should not crack, since it's pliable/elastic
    like acrylic... but maybe would peel if extreme or the epitaxial strain on
    the "wood support" causes flakes to detach underneath
  - i have _never_ touched lead paint to a brush afaik, btw
+ Lead paint exhibits similar geometry in alligator cracking bc...
  - well idk, but i'm guessing the combination of lead/polymer alignment has
    something to do with the geometry of bonds that lead forms
  - and guessing that changes deviating somewhat from this have more to do with
    how the mechanical changes in support/substrate influence strain
    distribution.

** Lead Swabs

The lead swabs after complete. The broken one was originally a control, where I
swabbed the inside of a glass jar, but I later reused it on the door (because
I'm poor and that mentality pervades my existence). The control test was valid.

*** Test 1

This one's definitely on fire.

*** Test 2

Before it more completely changed.

With the door more in perspective.

** Comparison

#+begin_quote
Didn't complete some of this. I was able to order lead tests.
#+end_quote

*** Large-scale alligator cracking

This image is kind of a baseline.

+ The background is explained from the video linked above. It's multi-layer lead
  paint (I think...)
+ The video explains that additional layers will crack with the same geometry.
  - IMO, if =primer ⊕ latex= is used, it will fill the cracks
  - There, the solidified latex will exhibit elasticity with completely a
    different mechanical basis for elasticity. It's likely to stretch less
    there, deform irregularly and "twist" off of it's local binding at points
  - From there, it will quickly want to peel off in sheets, but the lead paint
    will be hard, brittle and will [probably] remain firmly bound to the
    support. (idk what does a rembrandt do?)
  - This will probably happen within 2-8 weeks, depending on humidity
    permeability, heat and whichever side of the house the sun rises on.

*** Large Scale alligator-like cracking...

(... underneath paint layers, which requires some interpretation)

+ In these notice the geometry of the paint separation in layers underneath. And
  compare to the above.

*** Small Scale Alligator Cracking Affected by =Δ Humidity= and =Δ Heat=

If may explanation/rationale holds ummm water -- nothing beats a $20 lead test
-- then the typical alligator cracking geometry may not be preserved.

+ Local permeability increases as crack processes develop, which creates
  non-uniform support deformation/displacement (with highly-irregular effects,
  since the expansion of increased permeability cascades slowly along the edges)
+ What my "theory" can't explain: why isn't this seen in the lowest paint layer.
  This one is more plastic (the holes have round corners and fairly even
  placement). Or am I looking at a chemical response from an unknown paint
  vehicle ... like a primer or....

$20 lead test: saves you money and time =</jingle>=
#+end_quote

** Alternate $2 testing methods

In these situations, I've literally researched reactions to produce color change
to detect mercury (from powder) or lead (from paint chips)... but no. No money.

LED UV Lights are a bit dangerous, honestly, and they /basically do not detect
any non-organic compounds/, nor do they exhibit a clear response for organic
compounds.

* Caveat

#+begin_quote
I hate crying wolf and I love proving myself wrong. TL;DR: I'm poor. I cannot
afford testing and I don't know where to go to ask for help, esp. regarding a
technical topic such as this.
#+end_quote

Note, lead testing kits online are dubious quality and I am poor. I've tested
for lead on one other object [... under very dubious assumptions that a crock pot
could lose its ceramic coating and leach lead].

That was about 10 years ago with certainly +inconclusive+ negative results. Just
based on the marketing of lead test kits online, I quickly developed zero
confidence in those products. I tried anyways... but idk.

+ With a completely senseless pricing structure
+ Many undoubtedly fake reviews (basically paid fingerpointing to influence
  customer preference for higher pricing)
+ Many frustrated reviews ... because it's _not_ actually easy for the average
  person to "connect the dots" when following instructions (e.g. cross
  contamination, expiration, handling)
+ Very few handling or expiration indications, except what's legally required
  (barebones warnings/procedures are sometimes case for things like this). These
  don't conclusively prove anything. They're meant as a preliminary test or a
  quick "holy shit throw it in the ... garbage?" kind of product

The primary reason I started looking for lead was because certain low dosages
over time could explain various symptoms, but primarily systems dysfunction.

+ Very low chronic differs almost entirely from a "normal" acute dose. The
  development of toxicological pathology is also distinc
  - So a very low infrequent acute dose or maybe a gradual chronic dose.
+ Offhand I can't recall the specifics of symptoms distinguishing these (but
  lead affects many organ systems).
  - What I was looking to explain at the time *may* have involved neurological
    symptoms... idk. I was more concerned with explaining irregular kidney
    dysfunction (see [[https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/lead-exposure-and-kidney-function][national kidney foundation]]).
  - If kidney disfunction results from a toxicological cause, it doesn't present
    with well-recognized development & symptoms. I'm almost certainly wrong
    about the lead cause ... since it should present alongside many other issues

Sadly (as mentioned above), I am poor as fuck... I'm also a bit difficult to
deal with -- e.g. a lot of technical questions. However, $15 and a lead test is
a great way to prove me wrong, isn't it? I've had some other concerns like
Carbon Monoxide, but these often show up as brief recurring anxiety/chemophobia
... where the combination these factors prevents simple rational action to
dismiss concerns.

+ Other people (who are never in my house) enact dismissive handling when
  presented with _almost any technical concept, WHATSOEVER_. I don't own a
  business or a building, so I _do not_ have property management experience.
  They've owned a business/building for 40+ years.
+ my Sub-Saharan salary and persistently =<$100= bank account balance prevent me
  from testing discretely or quickly. It's not a one-and-done "buy it now"
  purchase. It's always: should I pay _twenty percent_ of my bank account
  balance for three lead tests? or _fifty percent_ of my "savings" for 25+ lead
  tests (which is suspicious as hell!)

Also ... holy shit basically five distinct people have been in that bathroom in
the past 5 years. Going back a decade, maybe fifteen! Before that though... many
many people had been in there (not enough humidity damage to exhibit the
cracking though)
