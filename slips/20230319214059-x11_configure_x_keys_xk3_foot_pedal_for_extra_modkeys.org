#+title: X11 and Wayland: Configure X-Keys XK3 Foot Pedal For Extra Modkeys
The X-Keys keyboards are produced by P.I. Engineering a great company that makes
pretty much everything open source, including the STEP files. Their keyboards
are like industrial strength and completely customizable.

    the device into the X11 Server.

* Issues

I bought this a long time ago: like 2011/2012? I had planned to get some of the
other keyboards, but they are more expensive...

** Using X-Keys as modkeys in OSX
+ It seems like OSX keeps track of the input device that's sending it keys. I
  can't remember whether I tried with Linux or not, but you have to build things
  yourself. The =Makefile= is pretty straightforward, so it's possible.
+ Anyways, you end up running into an issue where you can activate the modkeys,
  but hitting keys on the main keyboard just results in normal keypresses. There
  may have been some way around it, but I can't remember. The OSX software at
  the time by default let you do pretty much anything except use the pedal for
  modkeys :(

** Building their Linux software as packages using Guix

Eventually ... I'm going to get around to using this XK-3.

* Topics

** Builds


According to support (as of 2022), the =XK-3= pedal requires being reprogrammed
in Windows/Mac OS X

*** On Guix

Suggests

Some of their apps/hardware would make good RevEng practice for B-Sides

+ For some of their apps ()

+ Ghidra/etc for static/? analysis on the binary to see if constants/strings can
  be extracted? these may hint at the structure of NVRAM/etc

+ also a zip on their site
