#+TITLE: Medicinal Mushrooms: Beta-Glucans as Probabilistic Programs
#+CATEGORY: slips
#+TAGS:  
* Roam

So while I’m on the topic of Post-Translational Modifications (PTM’s),
beta-glycan illustrate the idea of probabilistic programs that modulate state as
conditional bayesian distributions *encoded into beta-glycan* chains. This is
regularized through spatial compartmentalization of state
(organ/tissue/capillary network/cell/organelle).

* Fungal Metabolism

Fungi take a completely different approach to finding/eating food than their
animal descendents: their mycelium grow into a decaying food source with many
foreign chemicals and something like the immune system tags pieces it recognizes
for metabolization. In the presence of these tags, it accelerates the breakdown
and reconsolidation of foreign matter into common units it can move and store.
To do so, it identifies “shortcuts” through the configuration-space of molecule
arrangements that retain the enthalpy of organized matter while circumventing
total decay into disorganized entropy.

In our bodies, some of these sugar chains are rare. We can integrate these
sugars by ingesting mushrooms while circumventing total digestion in the stomach
— the pH of which acts as a locked gate of sorts. The right meal with the right
fiber with the right fluid can allow up to two magnitudes greater absorption of
active chemicals than most scientific studies would find.

Since science disregards subjective experience and limits the
control/experimental variables to “what is necessary or relevant” they often
pass over chemicals/supplements for experimentation on this basis. If the diet
of human/rat subjects is not measured/modulated, there should be much greater
variation in many signals including plasma concentrations. In a few
methodologies, this ablates away the “magically p-value” into the zone of
statistically stupid.

Hopefully computational science can find what we’ve been missing the whole time.

* Categorical Probability and Statistics 2020

This math combines tensors and categories, producing an algebra that can be used
as a basis for probabilistic programs ... or just machine learning.

Applications include:

+ Agent-based simulations and prediction of weak emergence in such.***
+ Encoding "programs" based on fuzzy logic
+ Metanomics simulations that compress computation by emulating interactions
  between system units.
+ Extending control theory with stochastically informed modulation of the system
+ Recognition of novel or anomalous system dynamics (eigenphase identification)
+ Renormalization of recognized dynamics clusters into optimally disentangled
  representations of such ... if the system can be renormalized.

(***) Provided that measurability issues can be addressed... for reference here's
the only random paper I could find that doesn't involve quantum physics:
[[https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/renormTNSE15.pdf][Algorithmic Renormalization for Network Dynamics]].

Quantum physics mostly consists of physicists throwing every advanced statistics
tool they can at natural laws. Most of these statistical methods descriptive in
any context, but some can also be prescriptive. Most pop-science enthusiasts
have a hard time distinguishing between describing a system's observed behavior
and it's mechanics. As much as I hate material reductionists, here's how the
LessWrong wiki humbly sums it up: [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/34Q5PJEaDCriijkc7/natural-laws-are-descriptions-not-rules][Natural Laws Are Descriptions, not Rules]]. They
are probably less wrong than I though ... but still wrong.
