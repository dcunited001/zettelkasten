#+TITLE:     Julia Setup

#+begin_quote
From December 2020 until the potential Clojure interview & working with family
friend, I was trying to learn Julia by taking [[https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall20/][MIT 18.S191 Introduction to
Computational Thinking For Real-World Problems]]. As I was starting that, someone
reached out to me on github and offered to work together. It may have been
because I was pushing directly to a public GH repo while a class was in session
(idk really). But it's one of the rare times when I've actually had someone give
me feedback.

I didn't spend enough time on this and fumbled with communication, then
struggled with anxiety related to not responding to this person until I guess I
had eventually forgotten about it.

It's very easy for me to lose touch with things while I'm acclimating to a new
Linux system. I've never had an ipad or anything to use as a stable platform or
communication device. Web applications are always hell on my ADD. I never used
browser-based notifications -- i generally decline any permissions request as
annoying/unnecessary. I NEVER SAW ANYONE ELSE _IRL_ *EVER* RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION
FROM A WEB APP TO WONDER /HMMMM/ WAIT YOU CAN DO WHAT?

Again, no one took me seriously or understood that I was trying to use Julia (or
programming generally) to get a job by learning about data science, finding
financial datasets, learning economics ... etc all trying to create something I
could show someone that would compensate for my lack of a career. No one in my
family ever took any of my "lifelong learning" seriously.

* Julia Setup
- add =JULIA_HOME=/data/dev/.julia= to =~/.profile=

** Julia Community
- Julia chat: [[https://julialang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/230248-catlab.2Ejl][Zulip]]

*** [[https://www.algebraicjulia.org/][Algebraic Julia]]
- [[https://www.juliabloggers.com/notes-on-synthesis-and-equation-proving-for-catlab-jl/][Catlab.jl]]
- [[https://www.algebraicjulia.org/assets/slides/mit-seminar-2020/#40][Alg. Julia slides]]

*** Julia IDE
- [[https://junolab.org/][JunoLab]]

** Cheatsheets
[[https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/julia-cheatsheet.html][Quant Econ Julia]]

** Dependencies
See [[file:github.com/olynch/julia_setup][Julia Setup]] for an example (but it uses conda and runs notebooks on host as
root)

[[https://cloud.google.com/][Google Colab]] would require Julia running locally anyways

*** Python
- [[https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog/managing-python-environments/][Fantastic blog on Python environments]]
  - or use python in order to not give a fuck

*** Docker Images
- Official [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuYgEv40s7A&list=TLPQMzAxMjIwMjAxLQf7xRSmQQ&index=1][Docker for Data Science]] (video for Julia)
- [[https://github.com/felipenoris/math-server-docker][felipenoris' math-server-docker]]
- [[https://github.com/QuantumObject/docker-ijulia][another option]]

after building on the host computer, refer to [[https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/running.html][jupyter docs]] because your dumb ass
will google that shit again.

- [[https://discourse.julialang.org/t/emacs-based-workflow/19400][Emacs-based Workflow]]

*** [[https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Binder]]
Makes a repo full of notebooks more reproducible by helping manage dependency

complexity (sets up a running node w/ env in the cloud) - [[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way]["The Turing Way"]] for
reproducible data science - [[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder-julia.md][Binder setup for Julia]]
