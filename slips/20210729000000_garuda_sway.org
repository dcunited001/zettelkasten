#+DESCRIPTION: notes
#+category: slips


* XDG

  + [ ] document the XDG config that I tried

* System

** Setup [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Package_signing][Keyring]]

Although Garuda has already done this, redo it with an HKPS keyserver
just to be sure. Add =keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com= to
pacman's =/etc/pacman/gnupg/gpg.conf= and then:

#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
#+END_SRC

The default GPG config for pacman may need some more work. Also add
the keyserver line to your =~/.gnupg/gpg.conf=.

** Pacman

*** Yay

    Yay is needed for =passwordsafe=, =emacs-git= and others.

** Critical Tools

*** PWSafe

    + import the key by fingerprint
      - go to [[https://pwsafe.org/contact.php][pwsafe.org/contact.php]] or find [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/passwordsafe/][passwordsafe on AUR]] to
        locate the key fingerprint
    + the pacman-key setup should be completed first.
      - ensure you are using HKPS and not HKP!
      - however, it is unclear (to me without further reflection)
        whether importing with a =gpg= command inherits the pacman
        config.
        - =gpg= will start writing configs in =~/.gnupg/= if you don't
          have them, so i'm assuming that it doesn't inherit those
          settings.
      - if not, there is some bad advice on the =!aur passwordsafe=
        page. since =pacman-key= uses mostly the same syntax, the
        =passwordsafe= author's key needs to be imported to that
        keyring
        - ultimately, pacman/yay will ask you to import the key into
          pacman's ring if it has not effectively been imported yet.

#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo pacman-key --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys
        $KEYID

yay -Syu passwordsafe
#+END_SRC


* Dotfiles

  + I want to reintegrate things into a git repo:
    - either with submodules
    - or with something like dotcrafter

** [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html#Terminology][Stow]]

   + [ ] create a =.stowrc= (?)
   + [ ] and a =.stow-global-ignore= set
   + [ ] and per-package =.stow-local-ignore= files
   + [ ] plan out how this works for:
     - multiple WM's
     - literate dotfiles (and their deploys)
   + [ ] create an install script

* Tools

** TODO [[SystemCrafters/crafter-configs][Ranger]]

Ranger is written in python. Try NNN first.

  + [X] Copy ranger config: =ranger --copy-config=all= then set
    =RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC=FALSE=
    - ranger will no longer start from wofi
  + [ ] Config ranger


** [[https://github.com/jarun/nnn][NNN]]

NNN is written in C++, but plugins are in shell :(

+ Plugins:
  - Gutenburg (download from project gutenburg)

** Ungoogled Chromium

   This takes forever to build but is a program where there is *some*
   _non-DOM_ benefit to a local build. For me, it took 12
   hours. Chaotic AUR will simply replace this, so if you care, note
   it in your =/etc/pacman.conf= or all that time was wasted.

   If you already have a build package for your =ungoogled-chromium=
   or another browser, then import with =sudo pacman -U
   pkgfile.forgot.ext.name= -- firefox and its derivatives also take
   forever...

* Emacs

** Building Emacs

   + Install yay
   + =yay -Syu emacs-git --editmenu=
     - modify the =PKGBUILD= to ensure =JIT=YES=
     - Build, then test with =emacs --

   The standard emacs org-mode is alright for notetaking from here
   until more of the system is configured.

** Chemacs

** Doom Emacs

** Emacs Config


* Sway

+ [[https://github.com/japhir/ArchConfigs][Ilja Kocker]] A system crafters community example config using Arch/Sway
+ [[https://gitlab.com/ethancedwards8/dotfiles][Ethan C Edwards]] Another Syscraft example config: multiple WM; uses sway.

+ [ ] Make wdisplays settings permanent (resolution/orientation)
+ [ ] Remove transparency
+ [ ] Config waybar
+ [ ] Config wofi
+ [ ] config

** Floated Apps

+ pwsafe
+ settings apps

*** TODO find out how to float specific app windows?

** Config

   + =/etc/sway/config= exists but isn't used unless necessary
   + =~/.config/sway/config.d/defaults=
     - originates from Garuda's =/etc/skel=

** Sway keybindings

    + Refer to [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/Shortcut-handling][shortcut handling]] to get info on bindsyms
    + use =wev= or =wshowkeys= to get keysyms

** XKB

   + Add keyboard to =/usr/share/X11/xkb/= in =./symbols/io= and
     update =./rules/evdev=
   + update =~/.config/sway/config.d/input= with the following and
     restart x/wayland/sway

#+BEGIN_SRC
input type:keyboard {
      xkb_layout "io"
      xkb_variant "altgr-intl"
      xkb_options "caps:hyper"
}
#+END_SRC

*** TODO fix IO/sway layout problems

    + [X] remap super+[0-9]
    + [X] fix super+shift+[0-9]
    + [ ] get sway to properly interpret the hyperkey

*** TODO determine whether updating =./xkb/rules/evdev.xml= is necessary

The =altgr-intl= variant wasn't defined in =evdev.xml= and was only
defined in sway's configs. is updating this XML no longer necessary?

*** Problems with Sway and IO layout

    + Anything with a digit shortcut needs to be remapped
      - Alt  +[0-9]
      - Ctrl +[0-9]
      - Super+[0-9] is sent to sway as Super+[)!@#$%^&*(]
        - Whereas Super + shift + [0-9] is effectively processed
          normally, since sym+shift+[0-9] is translated to [0-9] but
          the shift key is held down. The WM thus processes it as a
          normal Mod+Shift+[0-9]... wierd.

    + This also happens in KDE & Emacs and is one tradeoff with the
      digimon layout: you have to rework your standard hotkeys.
      - In MacOS this can be fixed in one place, but with XKB it
        means that you have to fix it in the receiving WM/app.

** Login Manager

???


** Wofi

*** NWGGrid

    This is what garuda includes in addition to Wofi. Remove it for now.



** Waybar


** HTOP


*** TODO htop is closing when opened

* Annndd
