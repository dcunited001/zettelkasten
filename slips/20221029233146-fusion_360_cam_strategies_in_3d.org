From [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwbrPiUpolo][360 LIVE CAM Basics - 3D Toolpaths]] (via autodesk)

+ [[https://materialsproject.org/][Materials Project]]: _EVERYTHING IS A FUCKING CRYSTAL_
  - spending a ton of time thinking about everything math/calculus helps alot

* General Tips

+ Inputs can be expressions ... !
+ Your autodesk account can be organized into projects

** Examples included in Fusion 360

Strategies can be copied/pasted from examples, which are access via the Data
Panel (under examples).

+ Basic Examples:
  - Basic Training
  - CAM
  - Design
  - Electronics
  - Generative Design
  - Simulations
+ CAM Samples:
  - General Process
    - Workholding ... !
    - Contact Boundary Points
    - How it's made
  - Printed Circuit Boards
    - Bantam (PCB)
    - PCB strategies
  - Misc
    - 2D strategies
    - Post Proc
  - Haas Demos
  - Machine Tables
  - Additive manufacturing

* Setup Tips

+ Max stay down
+ simple smoothing
+ set =MinRampDiameter= to =HelicalEntry / 4= to prevent CAM stratagies from
  eliminating tool paths in smaller boundaries/pockets
+ Kinematics, coolant & tool config can be configured
  - ... but probably should just be referenced from tool/machine params
+ Fixture/setup can be configured/imported as a model
  - it should be possible to find standard fixture models, but if not, these
    should be modeled and saved to a project that is easy to access (from the
    relevant contexts)

** Setup Params

+ "Faceoff" with stock offsets
  - requires face op (2D-only), faces off the entire stock surface

* Strategy Params

+ Boundaries :: points/contours/surfaces
  - constraints/optimization
  - these are essential to plan out when relevant.
  - running the machines when these are not configured properly can be costly if
    not extremely dangerous.
+ 2D Tool Boundaries ::  based on the selected wireframe surface
  - The normals for the model are relevant and impact the generated toolpath
+ Shaft/Holder :: collision avoidance
  - Pull away
  - Trimmed
  - Detect Tool Length
  - Fail on Collision (!!)
+ Smoothing :: this can result in smaller gcode program sizes
  - this limits the number of commands required to produce shapes that vary from
    the desired curve within a specified tolerance.
+ Lead-In (entry) :: specifies how the tool enters the cutting path
  - on engraving operations or finising passes, this may need to be adjusted
    - otherwise, the machine will leave "U" shapes across the piece.
    - removing these marks is not always possible, depending on the context.
+ Ramp Type :: for balanced entry into a material
  - the deformations of most materials will not be uniform if too much material
    is cut at once. =ramping in (like with a helical pass) balances & optimizes
    the radial/axial loads at the initial point of contact.=

* 3D Strategies

** Clearing

*** [[https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID09E44604-DAD8-47D6-ADC6-C100869DE724][Adaptive]]

**** Important Params

**** Purpose
+ Clear as much volume with optimized speed (for machine/tool kinematics & params)
  - utilize entire flute
  - constant tool engagement
+ Less overloading
+ Improved Tool Life
+ Variable Engagement
**** Notes
+ Heavy Radial Load
+ Light sideload
+ Adaptive can be incompatible

*** [[https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID63F97CC8-99FE-40B7-AFF1-061E826955B3][Pocket]]

**** Params
+ Stepover
+ Pass Direction
+ Morphed Spiral Machining
  - adjust the spiral curve for the toolpath
  - provides a smoother run on the machine (but distorts the texture w/o a
    finishing pass)
+ Extension method :: what to do on a pocket that cuts through the boundary of
  the stock
  - values: tangent/closest/parallel

**** Purpose

**** Notes


** Finishing

*** [[https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID-A6933B73-D98F-43AD-BCFD-A450D91C4E61][Steep and Shallow]]

+ important params :: threshold angle for toggling between parallel & scallow
+ purpose :: combine parallel & scallop operations where needed to simplify
  configuration within Fusion 360

**** [[https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID17CC1F90-A2A5-4CC3-80EB-B7972E327E0F][Parallel]] (side by side)

***** Params

***** Purpose
+ finishing passes

***** Notes
+ check top view for bad curves
  - this occurs when parallel passes cut over a fillet or some other curve that
    is not parallel to the configured orientation
  - if used as a finishing pass, this texture may be noticeable
    - ... but it's probably not worth a tool change (unless perhaps for a
      customer)

+ Can be used for texture/logos and engraving
  - slower to configure than within bantam, but when used as a texture for
    engraving the interiors, this results in faster passes
  - using parallel for engraving requires testing the tool & understanding how
    to manipulate the stepover to get a good effect on that material.

***** Params
+ Direction (both/other) :: specify/balance the material-removal direction used
  adjacent regions of the same toolpath.
+ Slope :: limit range of angles that a toolpath will cut

***** Purpose

***** Notes

**** [[https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUIDEA850013-D826-408E-B076-C613834A77F3][Contour]]

***** Params
+ Slow
+ Avoid/Touch :: specify surfaces to always avoid or to always remain touching
+ Rest Machining :: optimize runtime (on a finishing pass) to only "remove
  material that a previous tool could not remove"


***** Purpose
+ steep walls (it's for deep stuff)
+ Not so great on shallow work
***** Notes
+ probably needs a finishing pass
