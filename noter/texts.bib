Most robots and autonomous vehicles depend on noisy data from sensors such as cameras or laser rangefinders to navigate in a three-dimensional world. This book presents common sensor models and practical advice on how to carry out state estimation for rotations and other state variables. It covers both classical state estimation methods such as the Kalman filter, as well as important modern topics such as batch estimation, the Bayes filter, sigmapoint and particle filters, robust estimation for outlier rejection, and continuous-time trajectory estimation and its connection to Gaussian-process regression. The methods are demonstrated in the context of important applications such as point-cloud alignment, pose-graph relaxation, bundle adjustment, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Students and practitioners of robotics alike will find this a valuable resource.</jats:p>" :DOI "10.1017/9781316671528" :type "monograph" :created (:date-parts [[2017 8 8]] :date-time "2017-08-08T03:06:59Z" :timestamp 1502161619000) :source "Crossref" :is-referenced-by-count 303 :title "State Estimation for Robotics" :prefix "10.1017" :author [(:given "Timothy D." :family "Barfoot" :sequence "first" :affiliation [])] :member "56" :published-online (:date-parts [[2017 8 9]]) :container-title [] :original-title [] :deposited (:date-parts [[2022 6 11]] :date-time "2022-06-11T17:18:19Z" :timestamp 1654967899000) :score 1 :resource (:primary (:URL "https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781316671528/type/book")) :subtitle [] :short-title [] :issued (:date-parts [[2017 7 31]]) :ISBN ["9781107159396" "9781316671528"] :references-count 0 :URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/9781316671528" :relation nil :published (:date-parts [[2017 7 31]])).
