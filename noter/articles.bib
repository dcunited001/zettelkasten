  abstract        = {This work presents MLIR, a novel approach to building
                  reusable and extensible compiler infrastructure. MLIR aims to
                  address software fragmentation, improve compilation for
                  heterogeneous hardware, significantly reduce the cost of
                  building domain specific compilers, and aid in connecting
                  existing compilers together. MLIR facilitates the design and
                  implementation of code generators, translators and optimizers
                  at different levels of abstraction and also across application
                  domains, hardware targets and execution environments. The
                  contribution of this work includes (1) discussion of MLIR as a
                  research artifact, built for extension and evolution, and
                  identifying the challenges and opportunities posed by this
                  novel design point in design, semantics, optimization
                  specification, system, and engineering. (2) evaluation of MLIR
                  as a generalized infrastructure that reduces the cost of
                  building compilers-describing diverse use-cases to show
                  research and educational opportunities for future programming
                  languages, compilers, execution environments, and computer
                  architecture. The paper also presents the rationale for MLIR,
                  its original design principles, structures and semantics.},
