** Hyper Key

The issue is that my =xkb= keyboard is sending the =Mod4= keysym to wayland ... somehow.

+ [[file:/data/ecto/sway/core/wlroots/types/wlr_keyboard.c][wlroots/types/wlr_keyboard.c]]
  - here wlr_keyboard defines how the bits for modkeys are or'd together.


Dealing with this probably requires modifying the XKB =pc105= keybaord. See the
german neo2 keybaord for examples.
