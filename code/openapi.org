* OpenAPI Resources

** [[https://apis.guru/][Apis.Guru]]

This is a collection of links to OpenAPI references, almost rendering this ectorepo useless.

+ simple ui :: https://github.com/APIs-guru/simple-ui
+ APIs guru API :: https://apis.guru/api-doc/
+ APIs guru OpenAPI Directory :: https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory

** OAI: Open API Initiative

+ Open API spec :: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification

** Gubment API's

+ [[https://open.gsa.gov/api/codedotgov/][Code.gov]] an API to explore government API's
+ [[https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-api-client][Code-gov-api-client]]
+ [[https://github.com/GSA][GSA github]] almost 1,000 useless API's via grants I am not eligible to receive

* APIs

** Git Forge
*** Github

+ [[https://github.com/github/rest-api-description][github/rest-api-description]] Github's main API.
+ [[https://docs.github.com/en/graphql][Github GraphQL API Docs]] This is separate from their OpenAPI routes

**** OAuth Scopes

Can curl some routes (with a token) to see what permissions are required for it
and which this token has. See [[https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps][Scopes for OAuth Apps]],

but i'm still confused ... i've never really answered this question to
satisfaction: which permissions do I need on the GraphQL token to access public
data (and I think it's actually just none)

*** Bitbucket

+ [[https://developer.atlassian.com/server/bitbucket/reference/rest-api/][Bitbucket Server API's]]
+ [[https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/][Bitbucket API's]]
** LinkedIn

LinkedIn's data export does not include comments, posts & shares, despite what
is indicated on the help article...

*** Voyager

There is a python library to access data via voyager, but it recommends not
using your personal account, "if possible" -- that's not a good sign.

+ Visiting https://linkedin.com/voyager/api/identity/profiles/dcunit3d/profileView
  results in "CSRF Failed", so it's not designed to be used outside of the browser.
+ The library facilitates the authentication process and retrieves a valid
  cookie/session.
+ However, this [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/78417404][StackOverflow]] indicates that =r_member_social= is a "closed
  permission" as of 2024/3/15 (via the Marketing API)...

*** Legit LinkedIn API

+ [[https://developer.linkedin.com/][developer.linkedin.com]]
+ [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/dma/member-data-portability/?view=li-dma-data-portability-2024-11][Member Portability APIs]]: particularly, the [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/dma/member-data-portability/member-data-portability-member/?view=li-dma-data-portability-2024-11][Member API]] and [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authentication?view=li-dma-data-portability-2024-11][Authorization]] docs


**** Posts, Comments, etc

When using the Member API, you specify the data domain:

+ ALL_COMMENTS
+ GROUP_POSTS
+ SHARES
+ ARTICLES
