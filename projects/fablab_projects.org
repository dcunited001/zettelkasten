* Project Ideas

** Math

+ Apollonean Gasket Coasters
  - script in blender, convert to STL

** Engineering

*** ornithopter (heavy duty paper airplane)
- Pi Zero + accel/gyro
  - device gains height, reads vertical accel
  - spreads "wings" when accel.z approaches zero
  - modulates wings  glide in some aesthetically
    pleasing way (in autonomous fashion)
- tracks height, when pos.z = 10% (max(pos.z))
  - it opens a "parachute" that cushions the landing

** Art

*** Tools

+ Easel (desk/portable)
+ Canvas Stretcher
+ Aluminum Canvas

** Workshop

*** make a clamp

* Tech Ideas

** Mechanical

*** Control of Nitinol Wire
- heat up nitinol wire to produce motion
  - heat diffused across some material to spread it across the wire
- there may be some better way of controlling this
  - heat is inefficient, can't be reclaimed
  - lasers are too localized
- another approach: solder conductors to nitinol to channel electrical flow through high-resistance regions ... creating localized heat
