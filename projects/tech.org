* Quick Project Ideas

** Games
+ Emacs SMP "Code Platformer"

** Graphics
+ Stereoscopic rendering of proteins
  - use contrast/color/lighting to allow brain/eye to join the left/right images
    of proteins where some parts are separated in time
  - i.e. ligand binding
    - left: protein before ligand binding
    - right: protein after ligand binding
    - user controls modify:
      - $\delta t$ timescale
      - graphics display mode
        - highlight regions of change on left/right
        - change colorscheme to highlight $\delta E$ or simple change in position
** Misc
+ Browser extension to reduce the wc (wordcounts) of articles/transcripts
  - why? ... besides removing really godawful weasel words, such and so forther
