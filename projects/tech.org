* Quick Project Ideas

** Games
+ Emacs SMP "Code Platformer"

** Graphics

*** Stereoscopic rendering of proteins

+ use contrast/color/lighting to allow brain/eye to join the left/right images
  of proteins where some parts are separated in time
+ i.e. ligand binding
  - left: protein before ligand binding
  - right: protein after ligand binding
  - user controls modify:
    - $\delta t$ timescale
    - graphics display mode
      - highlight regions of change on left/right
      - change colorscheme to highlight $\delta E$ or simple change in position

Basically, a plugin to Nanome.ai [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4D4TJ9JbMU&t=673s][See video on DMT and Serotonin 2A Receptor]], though they
don't seem to have figured out how to highlight details by abusing the
stereoscopic interface (probably not easy)

** Misc

+ Browser extension to reduce the wc (wordcounts) of articles/transcripts
  - why? ... besides removing really godawful weasel words, such and so forther
