* Structure

** ssh-tpm-agent

A binary build for =ssh-tpm-ca-authority= isn't needed: it's already built into
the =ssh-tpm-agent= release. Same for =go-tpm-keyfiles= and a few others.

* UML

This diagram is neither complete nor up-to-date (also the layout kinda makes it
useless). It's missing =tpmkey-fido=
