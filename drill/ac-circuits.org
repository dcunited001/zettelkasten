* Ideas for questions:
+ diode drops/characteristics for LED's
  - how/why does this relate to the bandgap & crystal

* Ideas/Questions
+ Can a capacitor be combined with an inductor?
  - e.g. one half of the component is a typical cap, but the charge would
    connect to the other side, which would have many connections branching off
    into an induction device (a braid or loop designed to feedback and modulate
    the dielectric constants)

** Cards
*** Formula :drill:
**** Voltage Gain
$A_{V}=\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}$
**** Voltage Gain (dB)
${A^{\prime}_{v}=20*\log{frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}}}$
**** Power Gain
$A_{V}=\frac{I_{out}V_{out}}{I_{in}V_{in}}$
**** Power Gain (dB)
${A^{\prime}_{p}=10*\log{frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}}}$

Types of rectifier circuits:

**** 1
Half-wave

Difference between diode limiting & clamping:

**** Limiting


**** Clamping

*** Application :drill:

Explain the mechanisms of solar panels

**** How are diodes applied to the design?

**** How does sunlight create a voltage potential?

+ How does that cause current to flow?
+ How is the movement of free energy controlled? And eventually stored?

*** Application :drill:
What protections do most IC regulators have to protect against input fluctuations and environment?

**** Answer
+ Internal voltage reference
+ Short-circuit protection
+ thermal shutdown circuitry

*** Application :drill:
IC regulators produce positive & negative voltages. How do their internals differ and how does this change their interface to the external circuitry.

**** TODO Answer
*** Application :drill:
What should determine the capacitor values that surround an IC Regulator in a bridge rectified power supply?

**** TODO Answer (complete)

This is based on the RC Time Constant

** Weak Points
+ rectifier filters & IC regulators
  - "the capacitor filter reduces the input ripple to the regulator to an acceptable level"
  - This is determined by the ripple factor.
  - $V_{r(pp)}$ :: peak to peak ripple voltage
    + This is determined by $(\frac{1}{f})(\frac{1}{R_L*C})*V_{p(rect)}$
    + that corresponds to the period divided by the RC time constant. When the Cap increases,
+ Diode Limiting & Clamping
+ Example 2-2: calculate the peak & rms voltages in a CT-Full-Rect, given the input voltages and turns.

*** Concept :drill:

Compare line regulation versus load regulation

**** Line Regulation
A measure of $\Delta V_{out}$ compared against $\Delta V_{in}$.
**** Load Regulation
A similar measure that compares the change in output voltages when $R_{L}$ changes from min to max.

* Chapter 4

** Main Objectives

*** Describe the basic classifications for FETs

*** Describe the construction/operation of JFETs

*** Describe three bias methods for JFETs

*** Explain the operation of MOSFETs

*** Discuss & Analyze MOSFET bias circuits

*** Describe the operation of FET linear amplifiers

*** Discuss MOSFET analog/digital switching circuits

** Misc Info
+ =DC= behavior for FETs is distinct among FET types
  + e.g. JFETs are biased differently than E-MOSFETs.
+ JFETs and MOSFETs respond similarly to =AC= signals.
  + Thus, they have similar =AC equivalent circuits=

** FET Characteristics
+ High input resistance & low electrical noise

** Cards

*** Why have MOSFETs become the dominant type of transistor for digital circuits? :drill:

**** Answer
They can be fabricaed in much smaller areas than BJTs
**** Answer
Ease of manufacture on ICs
**** Answer
They produce simpler circuits with no resistors or diodes
